 * box reaches a player who has never been judged.
 *
 * The seven queries are each bounded and go out together, so the page waits for
 * the slowest rather than for the sum. The fold that turns five of them into rows is
 * pure and lives in [`players-index.ts`](../../../lib/players-index.ts) with its
 * tests.
 *
 * Everything below the tiles is one client island, because the search box has to
 * filter as it is typed in and the three controls are remembered in
 * `localStorage` rather than in the URL — see
 * [`players-browser.tsx`](../../../components/players-browser.tsx) for why this
 * screen is the exception to the app's URL-state convention.

          `MatchSquad`, so a signing with no squad row is genuinely absent until
          a round he is named in has been synced — and "named in a squad" rather
          than "played" is the accurate line, because an unused substitute is
          listed here and can be judged.
