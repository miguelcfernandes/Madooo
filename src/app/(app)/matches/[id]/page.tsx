/**
 * One team's half of the page: its starting eleven above its bench.
 *
 * The two clubs are two nested columns rather than four panels dropped into one
 * grid, and that is a layout decision with a reason. Auto-placement would put
 * the home bench into the away column, and below `md` it would stack as
 * home XI → away XI → home bench → away bench, which reads as nothing at all.
 * Nesting gives the drawn desktop layout and a narrow layout of one whole club
 * followed by the other.
 *
 * What nesting costs is that the two columns size independently, so a note on
 * one club's eleven would push only that club's bench down and the two benches
 * would stop starting at the same height. `grid-rows-subgrid` is what buys the
 * shared rows back without giving up the nesting: at `md` this column stops
 * being a flex stack and becomes a grid that spans both of the parent's rows and
 * **adopts the parent's row tracks as its own** rather than declaring new ones.
 * Both eleven panels are then in one row, both benches in the next, and each row
 * is as tall as the taller of its pair.
 *
 * `items-start` with it, so a panel keeps its own height instead of stretching
 * to fill the row. A bordered list card with blank space under the last player
 * reads as something failing to load.
