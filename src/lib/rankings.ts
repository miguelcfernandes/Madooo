 * The vocabulary both indexes are drawn from: their sorts, their layouts, the
 * search normaliser and the league parser.
 *
 * The same table-plus-parser shape as [`diary-views.ts`](./diary-views.ts)
 * and [`player-views.ts`](./player-views.ts) — one list read by the control, the
 * empty state *and* the sort, so a slug cannot exist in storage that nothing
 * knows how to apply. Pure and Prisma-free, which is what lets
 * `rankings.test.ts` cover the comparators without a database.
 *
 * **The parsers read `localStorage`, not the URL, and that is the only
 * difference from those two files.** A stored value is exactly as untrusted as a
 * query parameter — it survives deploys, it can be edited by hand in devtools,
 * and it can name a league that has since stopped playing — so every one of them
 * falls back rather than refusing.
 *
 * Shared rather than copied per screen because a club and a player are ranked on
 * the same seven numbers and offered the same five sorts. Two sort tables meant
 * to agree cannot drift apart if there is only one of them — the argument that
 * made [`player-row.tsx`](../components/player-row.tsx) and
 * [`stat-tiles.tsx`](../components/stat-tiles.tsx) one component each. What stays
 * per screen is what actually differs: the storage keys, the row shape, and the
 * fold that builds it.
