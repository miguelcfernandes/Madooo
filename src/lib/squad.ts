 * A finer position label — `RB`, `CB`, `AM`, `LW` — is data that does
 * not exist anywhere in the provider's responses. `grid` ("row:column") holds
 * enough to guess a side, but the column convention is unverified and a wrong
 * guess prints a confident falsehood about a real player, so the four letters we
