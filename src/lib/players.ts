 * Every player named in a matchday squad this season, with the club, shirt

 *
 * **The one raw query in the app, and it is here because the Prisma forms of it
 * are all quietly quadratic.** "The most recent row per group" is what Postgres'
 * `DISTINCT ON` exists for, and Prisma cannot emit it: the column it distincts on
 * has to lead the `ORDER BY`, and the order wanted here is `match.kickoff`
 * through a relation. Two shapes were tried against the real database and their
 * SQL read back:
 *
 *   - `matchSquad.findMany({ distinct: ['playerId'] })` dedupes in **Node**, not
 *     in Postgres — there is an `InMemoryOps.distinct` node in
 *     `@prisma/query-plan-executor` that filters rows already fetched.
 *   - `player.findMany` with a nested `take: 1` does the same thing: the child
 *     query it emits carries **no `LIMIT`, no `LATERAL` and no `ROW_NUMBER`**. It
 *     selects every squad row for every matched player and keeps the first in
 *     memory. `relationLoadStrategy: 'join'`, which used to force a LATERAL, is
 *     not accepted by Prisma 7 at all.
 *
 * Either would therefore move a full season — 380 matches × ~40 players ≈ 15,200
 * rows — across the wire on every request of a `force-dynamic` page, to keep
 * about six hundred. Dev hides it completely: with one round hydrated there is
 * exactly one squad row per player, so all three forms return 400 rows and only
 * the emitted SQL tells them apart.
 *
 * This also folds in what were two further round trips — the player's name and
 * his match's league — so the page makes one query where it made three.
 *
 * Two things to hold onto:
 *
 *   - `$queryRaw` is a **tagged template**, so `${season}` becomes a bound
 *     parameter rather than string interpolation. `$queryRawUnsafe` is the one
 *     that would not, and nothing should reach for it.
 *   - The generic is an **assertion, not a check**. Raw SQL bypasses Prisma's
 *     mapping, so these column names are the database's own. That is safe today
 *     because no model in `schema.prisma` carries `@map` — adding one to
 *     `MatchSquad`, `Match` or `Player` would break this silently.
 *
 * `teamId` rather than the joined club: twenty clubs repeated across six hundred
 * rows are the same twenty clubs, and `teamsInSeason` sends them once.
