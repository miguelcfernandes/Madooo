/**
 * The players index's own arithmetic: the fold that turns three query results
 * into rows.
 *
 * The sorts, the parsers and the search normaliser moved to
 * `rankings.test.ts` when the teams index wanted the same five sorts. What is
 * left here is what is genuinely about players.
 *
 * Nothing here reads `scratch/`, unlike the sync mapper's tests: the fold is our
 * own invention, not the provider's, so a captured payload has nothing to say
 * about it. The same footing as `diary-views.test.ts`.
