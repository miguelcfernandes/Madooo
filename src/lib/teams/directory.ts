/**
 * Everything `/teams` reads. Our own tables only — nothing here can reach
 * API-Football, which is constraint #2.
 *
 * The index's counterpart to [`profile.ts`](./profile.ts), and the club-shaped
 * echo of [`players.ts`](../players.ts): a list of who exists, the user's own
 * activity read as rows to be folded, and the leagues the select offers. The
 * arithmetic stays in [`teams-index.ts`](../teams-index.ts), free of Prisma so it
 * can be tested. This module adds none of its own.
 *
 * **Clubs are read from `Match`, not from `MatchSquad`**, which is where this
 * file differs from `players.ts` rather than merely narrowing it. Two reasons,
 * and they are the same two `teamHeader` gives:
 *
 * 1. A club whose lineup was never published still played. Reading the list off
 *    squad rows would drop them from the directory entirely, where reading it off
 *    fixtures cannot.
 * 2. `Team` carries no `leagueId`. A club reaches a competition only through the
 *    matches they share, so the fixture is the only row that holds both — and
 *    taking the club and its league from one query is what makes `leagueId`
 *    non-nullable on an index row.
 *
 * Every query here is `OR`-ed across both sides of the fixture, which in Prisma's
 * `groupBy` means two calls rather than one clause: a club with no *home* match
 * is a state round-by-round hydration can produce, and it should still appear.
 * Each of those returns a club once per side, and `foldTeamRows` dedupes.
 *
 * The row shapes are declared in [`teams-index.ts`](../teams-index.ts) and
 * imported here rather than the other way round, so the fold's input and this
 * module's output cannot drift apart. `import type` is erased, so the pure module
 * stays free of Prisma.

/**
 * **This is the club list**, and deriving it from the same rows that carry the
 * league is deliberate: a separate query for each would let the two disagree,
 * and the fold would have to cope with a club whose competition is unknown.
 *
 * It moved to [`clubs.ts`](../clubs.ts) when the Champions League landed and a
 * club stopped having one competition. Three screens have to agree about which
 * one names a club, so the query and the rule that reads it now live together,
 * and this module keeps its import site rather than a second copy — the same
 * arrangement, and for the same reason, as `leaguesWithMatches` below.

 *
 * It needs one `some` clause where a player's needs two, for `teamTotals`'
 * reason: "this club played in this match" is a fact about `Match`'s own
