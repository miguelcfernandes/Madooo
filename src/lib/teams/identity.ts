 * **The fold through `searchKey` is not cosmetic.** Stripping everything outside
 * `A-Za-z` deletes an accented letter rather than folding it, so Beşiktaş drew
 * `BEI`: the `ş` vanished and the `i` moved up to take its place. That is not a
 * collision, which is a documented cost of the fallback — it is a wrong
 * abbreviation for a club whose name contains nothing unusual by its own
 * alphabet's standards, and it would have shipped looking deliberate.
 *
 * `searchKey` is the app's one rule for flattening a name, and reusing it here
 * is the same argument `leagueSlug` makes for reusing it there: two
 * normalisations that can drift is one more than the problem needs. It
 * NFD-decomposes and drops the combining marks, so `ş` becomes `s` and Beşiktaş
