/**
 * Who this club is, and which competition it played in.

 * matches they share, so the competition is read off this club's matches this
 * season — the same reading that makes a player's club a fact about a match
 * rather than a column on him.
 *
 * **It used to be `findFirst` with no `orderBy`, which was a bug waiting for a
 * cup.** One competition per club made any match the right match; two makes the
 * page say "Premier League" on one load and "UEFA Champions League" on the next,
 * from unchanged data. `clubMainLeagues` is the rule that settles it, and this
 * header, `/teams` and `/players` all ask it rather than each choosing.
 *
 * Three queries where there were two, all sent together. The third is every
 * league we hold — eight rows — because the tiebreak needs their names and
 * fetching only the two this club plays in would cost a round trip that depends
 * on the first.
 *
 * `league` comes back `null` for a club that exists with no match this season,
 * which is reachable by typing a URL and is the caller's empty state.

 * own `homeTeamId` and `awayTeamId` columns, so it sits in the same `where`
 * without ambiguity.
 *
 * Reading it off squad rows instead would quietly drop a match whose lineup was
 * never published while the opponent's was — the user recorded something, the
 * club played, and no `MatchSquad` row exists to prove it.
 *
 * So `watched` counts matches of theirs the reader had something to say about,
 * even where all of it was about the opponent. That is `/fixtures`' meaning of
 * the word narrowed to a club, which is what keeps one word to one meaning
 * across the three screens carrying it.

 * these column names are the database's own, so adding an `@map` to
 * `MatchSquad`, `Match` or `Player` breaks this silently.
