'use server'

/**
 * The app's Server Actions — the only code that writes.
 *
 * `'use server'` at the top of a file marks **every export** as a Server Action.
 * Next compiles the bodies out of the client bundle and leaves behind a
 * reference that POSTs back, which means each export is a public endpoint
 * reachable by anyone who can send that POST. Two consequences, and both are
 * load-bearing:
 *
 *   - Nothing but async actions may be exported from here. A helper exported
 *     alongside them would become an endpoint of its own — which is why
 *     `clearTag` below is deliberately module-private.
 *   - Every action authenticates and validates its own arguments. Rendering the
 *     buttons only on a signed-in page is not a security boundary; the request
 *     does not have to come from the page.

 * or a note, and a `CHECK` in Postgres is non-deferrable: only `UNIQUE`, foreign

 * statement runs and no transaction buys a moment where a row may say nothing.
 * Blanking the tag first therefore fails with `23514` on exactly the rows the

 * So: delete the judgements that are only a tag, then blank the tag on whatever
 * survives, which is precisely the ones carrying a note. Each statement leaves

 * endpoint, so a saved team is not "what the builder sent" — it is a claim about
 * eleven performances that has to be provable against this user's own
 * judgements. The one query below proves all of it at once: each squad row is
 * one this account marked MVP or STANDOUT, in the configured season, inside the
 * span being saved. Eleven ids in, eleven rows back, or nothing is written.
 *
 * The name and the chosen competitions cannot be proved that way — they are the
 * reader's own words and the reader's own choice — so they are validated for
 * shape instead: a name that is not blank and fits, and at least one competition
 * that exists.
 *
 * **The tag is read out of that proof, never taken from the caller.** The
 * graphic stars its MVPs, so a tag accepted as an argument would let a POST
 * award one to anybody. It is then *stored* rather than re-read on every render
 * — see `TeamOfTheWeekPick.tag` in the schema for why a saved team is a snapshot
 * and not a live view of the diary.
 *
 * **The shape is checked too, and against the same list the builder offers.**
 * Counting the lines and asking `isFormation` is what stops a saved team being
 * six goalkeepers; it is also why nothing stores a formation string, since the
 * counts *are* the formation.
 *
 * `refresh()` is deliberately absent, for `sendSuggestion`'s reason: the route
 * this fires from is the builder, which draws a pool rather than a saved team,
 * so re-rendering it would re-run one query to produce identical HTML. The
 * client navigates to the new team instead, which is what the returned id is
 * for.
