/**
 * The app's tab strip: switching the view of the screen you are already on.
 *
 * **Two tab vocabularies, and this is the one the app currently draws.**
 * `foundations.md` lists a 40px `--control-h-lg` "tab" and a 28px "pill tab" as
 * separate controls. An underline tab changes the *view* of the current screen —
 * the diary's filter, a player's Diary or Notes — and that is this. A pill
 * chooses the *scope* the screen is drawn for; the league row was its only
 * instance, and `/fixtures` retired it when the page became a day rather than a
 * league and a matchday. The control stays defined in foundations, with nothing
 * drawing it.
 *
 * **The underline sits under the selected tab alone, with no rule spanning the
 * strip.** That is how the reference screenshot draws it, and it is also what
 * lets the strip wrap: a continuous rule under a strip that had wrapped would
 * underline only the last row, leaving the selected tab on the first row
 * detached from it. Wrapping rather than scrolling sideways is 7.1's decision,
 * kept — a horizontal scroller hides its own overflow.
 *
 * Which tab is on arrives as a prop rather than being read from the location,
 * because every caller has already parsed the parameter to run its query.
 * Asking again in a client hook would give the answer two sources.
