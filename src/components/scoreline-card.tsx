          than spoken; `font-mono` overrides only the family `text-caption` sets,

          the arrangement inside it and `aria-hidden` — which was right until the
          clubs became links, because a focusable element inside a hidden subtree
          is reachable by keyboard and absent from the accessibility tree at the
          same time. Splitting them keeps both halves honest: the heading still
          announces "Chelsea 1–1 Arsenal" as one name rather than two clubs
          around a bare "1–2", and the links are ordinary links outside it.

          Everything in the arrangement that is not a link stays hidden, so the
          score is announced once, by the heading. That also keeps an unplayed
          match from reading as "Manchester United 15:00 Leeds", a scoreline that

            what pins both blocks against that middle column.

            Below `md` it stacks instead, each crest staying inboard beside the
            score. At 320px the row is arithmetically impossible: about 136px
            left for two 24px club names. `FixtureRow` sets its names at
            `--text-label` at every width — a row *is* a fixture line, which is
            the smaller role foundations gives one — and this deliberately does
            not follow it: a row is a different element with a different job,
            and the scoreline is still the thing the page is
            about, and shrinking it would be scaling for its own sake.

            `items-center` is written once and does double duty: `align-items`
