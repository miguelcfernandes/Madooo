/**
 * One diary entry: the date it was written, what was said, the player and the
 * fixture, and the note underneath.
 *
 * The row around it is [`judgement-entry.tsx`](./judgement-entry.tsx), shared
 * with the player profile. All this adds is the line beside the badge, which is
 * the only part the two screens draw differently.
 *
 * Both halves of that line are links, and both in ink rather than the link
 * colour, as the design draws them: the underline the base stylesheet adds on
 * hover is the whole of the affordance, because two blue half-sentences in every
 * row would be the loudest thing on the page.
