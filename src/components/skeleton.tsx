/**
 * The pieces every `loading.tsx` is built from.
 *
 * A skeleton exists so a click changes the screen at once instead of leaving the
 * previous page up while the server works. Next swaps it for the real page as
 * soon as the queries land, so the one thing it must get right is **geometry**:
 * a fallback whose boxes sit where the content will sit reads as the page
 * arriving, and one whose boxes sit anywhere else reads as the page jumping.
 *
 * Two rules from [`foundations.md`](../../docs/design/foundations.md) bind here
 * and are worth naming, because both are easy to break by reflex:
 *
 *   - **Nothing animates.** No pulse, no shimmer. The motion inventory is
 *     closed, and it says so: "no skeleton choreography". A static block is also
 *     the honest thing — a shimmer implies progress nobody is measuring.
 *   - **No hex, no raw px.** Blocks are `--surface-alt`, one step off the
 *     surface they sit on, and their heights come from the type roles below
 *     rather than from numbers.
 */

/**
 * One block standing in for one line of text.
 *
 * **The height is the type role's own line box, not a number.** The role class
 * is applied to a block containing a non-breaking space, so the box comes out
 * exactly as tall as the line it replaces — `text-title` is 24px over a 1.25
 * line-height whether or not anyone here knows that, and it stays right if the
 * scale is ever retuned.
 *
 * `className` is one string passed whole rather than a `role` prop assembled
 * inside, for the reason `stat-tiles.tsx` states about its `ink` field:
 * **Tailwind finds class names by scanning source as text**, so a name built at
 * runtime is one it never sees. Every caller writes its roles out in full.

 * single `sr-only` line says the one true thing instead, and `aria-hidden` on
