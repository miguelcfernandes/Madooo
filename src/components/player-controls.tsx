/**
 * The write controls on a squad row: the three verdict chips, the note button,

 *
 * **Why this owns the chips rather than sitting beside them.** The note button
 * and the note text are in two different cells of the row's grid — the button
 * beside the chips, the note on its own line underneath — but they share one
 * piece of optimistic state, and state has to have a single owner above both.
 * This component is that owner, and returning a **fragment** is what lets it
 * place two children into the parent's grid: a fragment produces no DOM of its
 * own, so both remain direct children of the `<li>` and the grid sees them.
 *
 * The chips arrive as `children` rather than through an import — the same
 * composition the shell uses to pass `<Sidebar />` into `AppFrame`. It keeps
 * `VerdictControls` free of any knowledge of notes, and keeps the row's markup
 * in `squad-panel.tsx` reading left to right the way it draws.

          React attaches a child's ref before its parent's, so the textarea is

          `showModal()` moves focus to the first focusable descendant, which is
          the close button, and this puts it where the typing goes. The caret
