 * square-cornered, with no shadow — so the page reads as one system rather than
 * as a dashboard bolted above a list.
 *
 * Both screens that have tiles draw the same four boxes over different numbers,
 * so this is generic over the keys rather than duplicated. The tables below are
 * what differ; the markup is the constant.
 *
 * Both totals types arrive through `import type`, which TypeScript **erases** at
 * compile time. A component file can therefore name a type out of a module that
 * imports Prisma without the client reaching the browser bundle — the import is
 * a compile-time fact only, and nothing of it survives into the output.
