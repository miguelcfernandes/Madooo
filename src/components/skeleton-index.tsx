 * the club index that way deliberately — "so the two grids read as one system
 * rather than as two" — so their fallbacks share a file for the same reason the
 * screens share a shape. What differs is a row's own contents, which each
 * `loading.tsx` passes in.

/**
 * The filter row: a search field, two selects and the layout toggle.
 *
 * The heights are `--control-h-lg` below `md` and `--control-h` above, which is
 * what `SearchField`, `SelectField` and `LayoutToggle` each set on themselves.
 * Written as the same arbitrary-property classes rather than as numbers, so a
 * retuned control height moves the skeleton with it.
 *
 * The search field takes the whole first line below `md` and shares the row from
 * there up — `basis-full md:basis-0 md:grow`, copied off the real one, because
 * this is the wrap that decides whether the row is one line or two.

 * The bordered list both indexes draw in their default layout: a strip carrying

 *
 * `children` is one row, rendered `rows` times. A React element is an immutable
 * description rather than a mounted thing, so repeating one is not sharing
 * state — and it keeps each caller writing its row once.
 *
 * **Eight rows, which is a drawing decision and not a prediction.** Both indexes
 * page in a batch at a time and hold hundreds of entries, so the real list is
 * always longer than this; eight fills a first screen without the fallback
 * running so far down that replacing it visibly collapses the page.
