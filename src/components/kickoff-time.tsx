/**
 * A kickoff, on the reader's own clock.
 *
 * **This exists because the server cannot know what time it is where you are.**
 * Every other date in the app is formatted on the server in a fixed
 * `Europe/London`, which is right for them — the day a fixture is filed under and
 * a diary's month heading are facts about the competition's calendar. A kickoff time is the one date that is
 * about the reader's evening rather than the season's shape, and only the
 * browser can say which evening that is. So this is a client island, and it is
 * the only one.
 *
 * The hook is the app's third use of `useSyncExternalStore` and the same reading
 * as [`use-preference.ts`](./use-preference.ts): a browser value the server
 * cannot see needs a separate server snapshot, so the server render and the
 * first client render agree *by construction*. The obvious alternative here is
 * worse than useless — `suppressHydrationWarning` keeps the DOM's text, which is
 * the **server's** London time, so it would suppress the warning and the change
 * with it.
 *
 * **The cost, stated rather than hidden: the first paint is London.** A reader in
 * Tokyo sees the English time for one frame after a cold load, then it swaps. A
 * reader in the UK — or in Lisbon, which shares the offset year-round — sees
 * nothing move at all. The alternative that removes the flash is a timezone
 * cookie set by a script in the head, which is still wrong on a first visit and
 * puts a cookie on every request to save one frame.
 *
 * No zone label beside the number, agreed rather than overlooked: the score slot
 * this sits in is sized for four characters and a bare monospaced numeral is what
 * foundations asks for.
 */

/**
 * The zone cannot change while the page is open, so there is nothing to
 * subscribe to. A module-level noop rather than a fresh closure per call: React
 * compares the returned unsubscribe by identity and would resubscribe on every
 * render otherwise.

/**
 * Resolved once per session, not once per render. `Intl.DateTimeFormat()` with
 * no arguments is the same constructor the module docblock in `dates.ts` calls
 * the expensive part, and React calls `getSnapshot` on every render.
 *
 * A string, which is load-bearing for the same reason `use-preference.ts` gives:
 * React compares snapshots with `Object.is`, so anything freshly allocated per
 * call would never compare equal and would re-render forever.
