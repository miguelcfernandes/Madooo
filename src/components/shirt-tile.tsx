/**
 * A player's shirt number on his club's colour, beside his name.
 *
 * **The second place in product code that carries a colour not from the token
 * set**, after [`crest-chip.tsx`](./crest-chip.tsx), and it reaches it the same
 * way: through `crest()`, which returns the club colour with WCAG-correct black
 * or white ink over it and falls back to a neutral `--surface-sunken` for a club
 * nobody has seeded. A wrong club colour reads as a fact about the club; a grey
 * one reads as missing data.
 *
 * Square, like the crest chip and every other box: the rebrand took radius to
 * zero everywhere, so the two marks that used to differ by two pixels of corner
 * now differ only by what they are.
 */

/**
 * The two sizes, **written out as whole class strings** — the same reason
 * `CrestChip` does it: Tailwind finds class names by scanning source as text, so
 * one assembled from the prop is a name it never sees and never generates.
 *
 * The number is half the box in both, which is what makes them read as one
 * object at two scales rather than as two components. `text-tally` exists for the
 * small one: the mono scale jumps 13px to 32px, and neither works in 40px.
