/**
 * A dropdown: the app's first `<select>`.
 *
 * **Native, not a hand-rolled listbox.** Keyboard behaviour, type-ahead, the
 * wheel a phone shows instead of a menu, and the popup's own light or dark
 * rendering all arrive for nothing — `color-scheme` already re-points the
 * browser's form controls, which is the same mechanism the theme switch runs on.
 * A custom listbox would be a large accessibility surface rebuilt by hand to gain
 * a styled popup nobody asked for.
 *
 * What styling a native select does allow is the closed box, which is the part
 * the design draws: `appearance-none` removes the platform arrow, and the
 * `expand_more` glyph beside it is ours.
 *
 * ### Why the league is a select here and was a tab row on `/fixtures`
 *
 * **A scope control says what the page was drawn for; a select narrows what is
 * already on screen.** The league row `/fixtures` used to carry was the first:
 * it named what the server had queried, it was a fact about which page you were
 * on, and it showed every league at once. In a row of filters over one list,
 * beside a search box and a sort, the same choice is a select — those controls
 * have to read as one set, and none of them changes what was fetched.
 *
 * The control that used to draw the first is gone: `/fixtures` is indexed by day
 * now, and the rebrand retired the pill tab it wore. The distinction survives the
 * control, which is why `foundations.md` still records it — a select in a filter
 * row is the only thing this app draws, and a scope control would need deciding
 * again before it drew another.
