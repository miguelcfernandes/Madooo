/**
 * A preference remembered in `localStorage`, read without a hydration mismatch.
 *
 * **This is the app's second answer to "the server cannot see what the browser
 * saved", and it exists because the first one does not generalise.** The theme
 * toggle solves it by holding no state at all: `data-theme` on `<html>` is the
 * state, CSS is the only reader, and an inline script in the document head
 * restores it before the first paint. Nothing here can do that, because a
 * preference that reorders a list cannot be expressed in CSS.
 *
 * The shapes that do not work, and why, since all three are the obvious thing to
 * reach for:
 *
 *   - `useState(() => localStorage.getItem(key))` renders one thing on the
 *     server and another in the browser, which is a hydration mismatch.
 *   - `useState(default)` plus an effect paints the default first and
 *     `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` rejects the shape outright.
 *   - Reading storage during render is the same mismatch as the first, wearing a
 *     different hat.
 *
 * `useSyncExternalStore` is React's own answer for exactly this: a browser API
 * that is not React state and differs between server and client. It takes a
 * separate server snapshot, so the server and the first client render agree by
 * construction, and React re-renders with the real value immediately afterwards.
 *
 * **The cost, stated rather than hidden: the first paint shows the default.** A
 * reader who chose Grid sees the list for one frame after a cold load. That is
 * the trade the localStorage decision buys, and the only thing that would remove
 * it is a store the server can read.
 */

 * Writers in *this* document, which the `storage` event does not cover — it
 * fires in other tabs only, by design, on the theory that the tab that wrote the
 * value already knows. React has to be told either way.

/**
 * Whether this browser has never stored anything under `key`.
 *
 * **The same machinery as `usePreference`, with the server snapshot the other
 * way round, and the inversion is the whole reason it is a separate hook.** A
 * preference defaults to the unstored value because that is the honest answer
 * before the browser has spoken — a reader who chose Grid sees Rows for one
 * frame, and the list is right either way. A one-time notice cannot do that: if
 * "nothing stored" rendered on the server, every reader who had already
 * dismissed it would watch it flash in and out on every single visit, which is
 * a worse fault than the one it is trying to avoid.
 *
 * So the server says `false` — *not* the first time — and the notice appears
 * only once the browser has confirmed otherwise. The cost is the mirror image of
 * `usePreference`'s and much cheaper: a first-time reader sees the notice a
 * frame late, and nobody else sees it at all.
 *
 * It shares `subscribe` with the rest of this module deliberately, which is what
 * makes a `writePreference` from the dismiss button reach this hook: the
 * `storage` event fires in other documents only, so the notify has to come
 * through the listener set both halves are registered in.
