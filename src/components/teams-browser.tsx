/**
 * The teams index below its header: the controls, and the list they draw.
 *
 * The second of the app's two client-rendered lists, and
 * [`players-browser.tsx`](./players-browser.tsx) is the template — that file
 * carries the full argument for why these three controls live in `localStorage`
 * rather than the URL, and what the first paint costs. In short: a *location*
 * belongs in the address bar, a *preference* does not, and nobody bookmarks Grid.
 *
 * **What is deliberately not copied is the row cap.** `SHOWN_STEP` exists over
 * there because ~600 rows would be re-examined on every keystroke; a competition
 * has twenty clubs, and five leagues would still be a hundred. A cap that never
 * triggers is a control that does nothing, and 6.1 refused one of those already.
 * That also means the "Show more" button, and the reset-on-filter-change dance
 * around it, are both absent.

 * screens that happen to use cards.
