/**
 * A search box: the app's first text input.
 *
 * `foundations.md` has had the tokens for one since the beginning — `--control-h`,
 * the 18px icon size "buttons and fields" get, and `focus-field` — and nothing had
 * used them. The `<textarea>` in the note dialog is the only field that existed
 * before this, and a dialog's one control is not a pattern.
 *
 * Built general rather than as part of the players index, because every list
 * screen that grows a filter row wants the same box. Nothing here knows what it
 * is searching — the screen owns the term and the matching.
 *
 * No `'use client'` directive: a module imported by a client component joins the
 * client graph on its own. Adding one would declare a second entry point to the
 * boundary for no reason, the same way `icon.tsx` does not have one.
