/**
 * The verdict split, drawn: a bar and the badges that name it.
 *
 * Extracted from [`verdict-split.tsx`](./verdict-split.tsx) when the players
 * index wanted the same bar without the card around it — a profile draws it as a
 * panel with a header and a legend, a list row draws it bare between a name and
 * a count. The card kept its own file; these two are the parts both screens
 * share.
 *
 * The arithmetic stays in [`verdict-split.ts`](../lib/verdict-split.ts), where it
 * is pure and tested. Both components take the segments already computed, so a
 * caller drawing six hundred rows calls `verdictSplit` once per row rather than
 * once per part.
 */

/**
 * Written out per key rather than assembled from it, for the reason Tailwind
 * forces: it finds class names by scanning source text.
 *
 * The **ink** tokens, not the `--*-mark` trio. Foundations scopes those to a
 * glyph on an inverse surface, and the ink is the better answer anyway — each
 * segment then matches the legend label beneath it exactly. Both read at a
 * glance in dark, where the verdict inks lighten rather than staying the light
 * theme's near-black.
 *
 * `Partial` says the thing the type would otherwise hide: **`unrated` has no
 * fill**, because it is the track showing through rather than a box drawn over
 * it. Keying on `SegmentKey` still makes a misspelt segment a compile error.

/**
 * The bar alone.
 *
 * **`aria-hidden`, and it carries `CrestChip`'s contract: whatever holds it has
 * to name it.** In the profile's card the legend directly below states every
 * count as text, so a bar announcing its own numbers would say the whole thing
 * twice. In a list row there is no legend, so the row supplies an `sr-only`
 * sentence instead — and the rule is the same either way, because the bar itself
 * cannot know which of the two it is in.
 *
 * The track is `--surface-sunken` and **the unrated segment is the track showing
 * through** rather than a fourth filled box. That is what the design draws, and
 * it also means the three drawn widths cannot leave a rounding gap at the
 * right-hand end. A player nobody has judged is therefore a bare track, which is
 * most of the league on the index and is correct.
 *
 * No margin of its own — the caller places it.
