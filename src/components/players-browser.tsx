 * The players index below its tiles: the controls, and the list they draw.
 *
 * **One of the two screens in the app whose state is not in the URL**, the other
 * being [`teams-browser.tsx`](./teams-browser.tsx), which this one is the
 * template for. Everywhere else — the fixtures page's day, the diary's filter, a
 * profile's tab — the choice is a *location*, so it lives in the address bar and the page
 * stays a server component. The three controls here are *preferences*: "how do I
 * like this drawn" rather than "what am I looking at". Nobody bookmarks Grid. So
 * they live in `localStorage`, which is also the only store that survives
 * closing the tab.
 *
 * The whole season's players arrive as a prop and the filtering happens here.
 * That is what makes the search box reach a player the reader has never judged
 * without a round trip — the stated point of the screen. It costs ~15 kB
 * compressed for a league of six hundred, which is less than one of the fonts;
 * the expensive part is drawing them, which `SHOWN_STEP` below pays for.
 */

/**
 * How many rows are drawn at once, and how many more each "Show more" adds.
 *
 * The reference drawings show every row, and they were made against a list of
 * eighteen judged players. The list is now the whole league, so ~600 rows would
 * be ~9,000 elements re-examined on every keystroke in the search box — which
 * would work directly against the one thing this screen is for.
 *
 * Nothing is hidden from search or sort: both run over the full array and the
 * header strip states the true count. Divisible by three, so the grid never ends
 * on a ragged row.
