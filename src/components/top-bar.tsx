/**
 * The top bar: the suggestion box, the source link and the theme toggle, and
 * below `md` a menu button.
 *
 * The design puts a search field in here too, and it is deliberately not here:
 * search belongs to the screen that has something to search, next to the filters
 * it works with, which is where `/players` and `/teams` each carry their own.
 * The bar is doing work without it: it is the fixed boundary the content scrolls
 * under, and it holds the frame at the height the page's own controls line up to.
 *
 * The menu button is not in the design at all. It is here because the reference
 * images have no mobile state to have put it in, and it exists only below `md`,
 * where the sidebar has become a drawer and needs something to open it. Which
 * is why the right-hand group carries `ml-auto` rather than the header carrying
 * `justify-between`: at `md` and up the menu button is not there to be spaced
 * away from, and the group would drift to the left edge.
 *
 * The source link is the third thing in here, and the bar is where it is
 * precisely because it is *not* a destination. It sat at the sidebar's foot
 * first, borrowing `NavItem`'s row height, icon column and hover fill, and
 * read as a fifth place to go. Up here it is chrome among chrome, beside the
 * only other control that leaves the page alone.
 *
 * **The suggestion box is the fourth, and it is the only one carrying a label.**
 * The same argument puts it here — it opens a dialog, so it navigates nowhere —
 * but not the same treatment, because it is the one control in the bar that has
 * to be found by someone who was not looking for it. It also takes the left, so
 * the bar now has an occupant at both ends at every width; `ml-auto` on the
 * right-hand group, which existed for the menu button's sake below `md`, is
 * what keeps the two apart.

        `ml-auto` moved off the toggle and onto this group when the source link
        joined it: two controls pinned right are the bar's arrangement to make,
        not something either control should assert about itself.

        `gap-0.5` rather than the usual `gap-2`. Both children are already
        `--control-h-lg` boxes with their glyphs centred inside, so the visible
        space between the two marks is most of that box, and a full gap on top
        of it reads as two unrelated controls instead of one cluster.

          20px, not the toggle's 22px. The mark is a solid silhouette where our
          own glyphs are a 1.75 stroke, so matching their box sizes puts far more
          ink on screen for the same nominal size — at 22px it read as the
          loudest thing in a bar that is meant to be quiet.

          The anchor carries the name, because `<GithubMark>` is `aria-hidden`
          and there is no visible label beside it to do the job. The same shape
          as the menu button above, and for the same reason.
