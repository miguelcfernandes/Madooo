/**
 * The three-letter code on a club-coloured rectangle, where the design would
 * otherwise put a crest. It is a substitute for a crest, not a step towards one:
 * `Team.logo` still renders nowhere, because club badges are a trademark
 * question this project has not cleared.
 *
 * **The one place in product code that carries a colour not from the token
 * set.** A club's colour is a fact about the club, not a decision about the
 * interface, so there is no semantic token it could ever be — it comes out of
 * the database and goes straight into a style attribute. `foundations.md`
 * records this as the single sanctioned exception to its no-hex rule.
 *
 * `aria-hidden` for the same reason `<Icon>` is: the club's name is next to it
 * and says the same thing. Every caller has to keep that true — the squad panel
 * headers name their club in an `sr-only` span precisely because this mark
 * cannot.
 */

/**
 * The two sizes foundations gives a club mark, written out as whole class
 * strings: **Tailwind finds class names by scanning source as text**, so one
 * assembled from the prop would be a name it never sees and never generates.
 *
 * `sm` is foundations' 20px "Badge, crest chip" row — a label sitting inside a
 * row of other things. `lg` is 40px: a mark carrying the identity of the whole
 * page is a tile rather than a label, and it is the same reading that sizes
 * `ShirtTile`. `xl` is 64px, the size `ShirtTile` takes in the same header slot,
 * so a club profile and a player profile open with a mark of one size. All three
 * are square-cornered, like every box in this design.
 *
 * **The letter role belongs to the size**, which is why it is in this table
 * rather than in the className below. `text-caps` at 20 and 40px: it is the only
 * role that is bold, tracked *and* capitalised, which is what three letters on a
 * saturated colour need to stay legible. At 64px it stops working — 11px of type
 * in a 64px box reads as a smudge in the corner rather than as the identity of
 * the screen — so `xl` takes `text-title`, a size the scale already has. Neither
 * takes `text-data`: a club code is not a number you can add up, which is the
 * whole of the rule that picks the monospaced family.
