/**
 * Light and dark, in the top bar.
 *
 * **It holds no React state**, which is unusual enough to be worth saying why.
 * The theme lives in one place — `data-theme` on `<html>` — and the only thing
 * that reads it is CSS: the attribute sets `color-scheme`, and every
 * `light-dark()` in `globals.css` re-resolves against it, including the two
 * rules that decide which of this button's icons is displayed. So there is
 * nothing for React to re-render, and nothing for it to remember. The click
 * handler reads the current theme back off the DOM.
 *
 * That is also what keeps the component free of the usual persisted-state
 * problems. The server has no way of knowing what the browser saved, so a
 * `useState` seeded from `localStorage` would render light on the server and
 * dark on the client and trip a hydration mismatch; seeding it in an effect
 * instead would paint the wrong icon first, and `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
 * rejects that shape anyway. With no state, none of it arises.

      No `aria-label` here, deliberately: the two spans below carry the name

      ever displayed, and `display: none` removes an element from the
      accessibility tree as well as from the page — so the button's computed
      name is always the one matching the theme actually on screen, with no
      JavaScript involved in keeping the two in step.
