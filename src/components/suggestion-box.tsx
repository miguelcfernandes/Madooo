/**
 * The suggestion box: a labelled button in the top bar, and the dialog it opens.
 *
 * **No `'use client'` here.** `top-bar.tsx` already carries the directive, and a
 * module imported by a client component joins the client graph on its own — the
 * directive marks an *entry point* to the boundary, not every file on the far
 * side of it. `search-field.tsx` and `icon.tsx` have the same shape.
 *
 * **This is the only labelled control in the bar, and that is deliberate.** The
 * GitHub mark and the theme toggle are bare glyphs because they are chrome a
 * reader already knows how to find. This one has a job neither of those has: it
 * has to be *noticed* by someone who was not looking for it, because a
 * suggestion box nobody sees collects nothing. The label is the whole of that —
 * it is the only run of words in the bar, which is loud enough in a strip that
 * is otherwise four glyphs.
 *
 * **An outline was tried here and taken back out.** It read as a box inside a
 * box: `foundations.md` opens with "the border is the primary separator", so in
 * this system a border marks off a region rather than dressing a control, and a
 * bordered button inside a bordered strip competes with the bar's own bottom
 * edge. If this ever needs more presence than the label gives it, the in-system
 * move is a resting `--surface-alt` fill hovering to `--surface-sunken` — one
 * step along the ramp, which foundations already sanctions — and not an outline.
 *
 * **The label stays at every width**, including the phone, where it sits beside
 * the menu button. It was hidden below `md` first, on the assumption that five
 * words would not fit next to a menu button at 320px; they do, and the bar reads
 * better for it. That is why the button is `whitespace-nowrap` — the failure
 * mode worth designing against is the label wrapping to two lines inside a 56px
 * rail, not the label being absent.
 *
 * A knowing departure from the bar's own pattern rather than an oversight.

    A callback ref rather than an effect: it runs as soon as the element is in
    the DOM and before paint, which is when `showModal()` has to be called — a
    `<dialog>` is inert markup until it is, and the attribute form (`open`)
    gives a non-modal dialog with no backdrop.

    React attaches a child's ref before its parent's, so the textarea is already
    known here. `showModal()` focuses the first focusable descendant, which is
    the close button; this puts focus where the typing goes instead.

    **Memoised for the same reason the note dialog's is**, which is the reason
    that one had a bug: React holds a ref by identity, so a ref written inline
    is a new function every render and React re-runs it on every one. Here that
    meant `focus()` firing again on each keystroke — harmless, because focus was
    already in the box — and then pulling focus *out of the Send button* the
    moment `pending` flipped and re-rendered. Stable, it attaches once on mount,
    which is when opening the dialog and placing focus is meant to happen.
