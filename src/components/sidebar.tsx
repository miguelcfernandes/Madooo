      Placement is not this component's job — `AppFrame` decides whether it is a
      grid column or an off-canvas drawer, and owns the classes that say so. What
      stays here is what the sidebar *is* at any width: 232px wide, full height,
      a column, and separated from the content by a border.

      `--sidebar-w` is fixed on purpose and does not scale with the viewport. A
      sidebar's width is set by what is in it; a fluid one would be dead space on
      a wide screen and would truncate its own labels on a narrow one.

        TEMPORARY — a note saying what just changed, above the identity because
        that is where the eye lands last and because it must not push the account
        menu off a short viewport. It dismisses itself to nothing, so the sidebar
        below is what it was.

        The one thing it costs this file: `<ChangelogNote>` is `'use client'`,
        which makes it a client boundary inside a server component. That is the
        narrow version and is fine — `AppFrame`'s note explains the rule, and the
        rule is about what `Sidebar` itself is, not about what it may contain.
        `Sidebar` stays a server component and the `<UserButton>` below stays
        server-rendered with it.

        Delete this and `changelog-note.tsx` to remove the note entirely.

        The signed-in identity, moved here out of the old dashboard header.

        This is Clerk's own component rather than our markup, which is a
        deliberate trade: it carries the account menu, and that menu is the only
        way to sign out. `appearance.elements` takes ordinary class names — ours
        win over Clerk's because `cssLayerName` puts Clerk in a layer below the
        utilities layer — so the name can be given the app's type even though the
        markup around it is not ours.

        Known mismatch with `foundations.md`, and left as it is on purpose: the
        avatar is the Google profile photo, or a coloured gradient when there is
        none, and the design forbids both photography and gradients.
