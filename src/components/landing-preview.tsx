/**
 * The mock match card the landing page's hero is drawn beside: four players out
 * of a fixture that was never played, judged the way the app judges them.
 *
 * **It is fiction, and it has to be.** `/` is the one route that prerenders, and
 * it stays that way by touching no database at all — a signed-out visitor has no
 * diary to show, and a stranger's would be private. So the rows are a constant
 * in this file rather than a query, and the result is invented.
 *
 * Not `SquadPanel`, for the same reason: that component's types are shaped by
 * the match page's query, and naming them here would drag Prisma onto a page
 * that must never reach it. What the two do share is the objects — the card, the
 * header strip, the shirt tile, the note's rule and the badge are all the app's
 * own, so what a visitor is shown is what they will get.
 *
 * The positions read `FWD`/`MID`/`DEF` rather than the drawing's `RW`/`CM`/`CB`.
 * The finer position is in no provider response, so the app has never had one to
 * show; a landing page promising a detail the product cannot render would be
 * advertising the mock rather than the app. Same decision as 6.3, 6.3b and 7.2.

/**
 * `UNRATED` exists in no enum: the app has no such state, because an unrated
 * player is simply one carrying no judgement, and the match page draws that as
 * three chips nobody has pressed. It exists here because a card showing only
 * judged players would misrepresent what a real one looks like — most players
 * stay unrated — and because the fourth row is what the "Left blank" line is for.
 *
 * Its badge is foundations' resting chip exactly: outlined and muted. It carries
 * no glyph, because the three verdicts own the three glyphs and there is none
 * for the absence of a verdict — foundations' own instruction for that case is
 * to use a word.
