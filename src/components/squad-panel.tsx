      Two lines below `md`, one line at `md` and up.

      The reference screens are desktop-only, so this arrangement is a decision
      rather than a drawing, and the numbers force it: at 320px a single row
      leaves about 88px for a name, which truncates "Gabriel Magalhães" to
      nothing useful. Foundations' rule is that layout changes arrangement at a
      breakpoint rather than scaling, so the controls drop to their own line and
      grow to a thumb-sized 40px instead of shrinking to fit.

      `min-h` rather than a fixed height, which is what 6.3 chose it for: the
      touch row height is the floor, and the row is now free to grow past it.

      A fixed 2rem first column keeps every shirt number on the same right edge
      however many digits it has, which is the whole reason it is monospaced.

      **Which column takes the free space is what places the position label.** At
      `md` it is the position's own column, so the name is sized to its content
      and the label sits directly beside it, as the design draws it. Below `md`
      it is the name's, which pushes the label to the right-hand edge — right
      there, because the controls have moved off this line and the edge is empty.
      The name truncates in both, since `truncate` sets `overflow: hidden` and a
      grid item with that can shrink below its own content.
