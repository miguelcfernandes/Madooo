name: slice
description: Run one vertical build slice end to end. `/slice start` branches, implements, self-reviews the diff and updates the docs; `/slice finish` squash-merges into main, pushes main and deletes the branch — and since Vercel builds from main, that deploys, so the author runs it. Use when building a feature the author has asked for.
---

# Slice

One vertical feature, from an agreed plan to a merged `main`. `start` does the
whole slice; `finish` only lands it, once the author has seen it work in the
browser. The split exists for that browser check, which only the author can do.

Read the argument to decide which phase to run:

- `start` → [Phase: start](#phase-start)
- `finish` → [Phase: finish](#phase-finish)
- anything else, or no argument → say which phases exist and stop.

`start` assumes [`docs/roadmap.md`](../../../docs/roadmap.md) has been read this
session. If it has not, read it first. Read the sections of
[`docs/architecture.md`](../../../docs/architecture.md) covering the subsystems
this slice touches before implementing.

---

## Phase: start

### Preconditions

Check all of these before touching anything. If any fails, stop and say why.

1. **A feature has been asked for.** It does not need a plan agreed in advance —
   scope it yourself. Enter plan mode instead when the shape of the work is
   genuinely open, or when it turns on a decision that is the author's: an
   unsettled product rule, a schema change or migration, anything touching the
   non-negotiables in `AGENTS.md`, or a change to what a screen promises a user.
2. Working tree is clean.
3. On `main`, and `main` is up to date with `origin/main`.

### Steps

**1. Branch first, before any file changes.**

```
git switch -c slice/<short-kebab-summary>
```

Retrofitting a branch after committing to `main` is the failure this ordering
exists to prevent.

**2. Write tests where they earn their place — not "if applicable".**

Test:

- Pure functions with a real payload as input. The sync mapper is the case that
  exists so far.

Do not test:

- Prisma, Next's rendering, Clerk, or anything else third-party.
- Schema migrations and wiring, which have no meaningful assertion surface.

**Fixtures are read from the captured payloads in `scratch/` at test runtime.**
Never JSON typed from memory, and never JSON pasted into the test file. Assert
against values pulled out of the real file. The reason is specific: if the same
understanding writes both the mapper and its fixture, they agree with each other
and are both wrong, and the test proves nothing. The captured response is ground
truth; recollection is not.

**3. Implement.**

Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any
Next-specific code — the rule at the top of `AGENTS.md`, applied here because
this is the moment it binds.

Hold the non-negotiables in `AGENTS.md` while writing. Step 7 reads the diff for
breaches of them, but that is a backstop, not the place they are meant to be
caught.

**4. Run the gate.** All of these, not a subset:

```
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
npm test            # if tests exist
npm run build       # if routes or rendering were touched
```

`tsc --noEmit` is the highest-value feedback loop in this stack. Do not skip it
because the build passed.

**5. Failure rule.**

Two failed attempts on the same failure → stop and report it. Do not attempt a
third fix.

**Never weaken an assertion, loosen a type, or add a cast to make something go
green.** A failing test is sometimes correctly reporting that the agreed plan is
wrong. If that is the reading, say so plainly and stop — that is a decision for
the author, not a thing to code around.

**6. Commit at every working state.**

Each commit must run. Commit messages carry **no** `Co-Authored-By` trailer and
no AI attribution of any kind.

**7. Check the diff against the fixed criteria.**

```
git diff main...HEAD
```

This is a checklist, not a review. The same understanding that wrote the code is
reading it, so it cannot judge whether the design is right — it can only run
specific queries over the accumulated whole, including the debug line added
three fixes ago and the files you forgot you touched. Check for:

- Secrets or connection strings outside `.env.local`.
- A hardcoded season year.
- Any API-Football call reachable from a page render.
- An unchecked `errors` field on a provider response.
- Provider JSON shape leaking past the sync boundary.

Fix trivial findings. Report substantive ones rather than silently rewriting the
agreed plan.

**8. Update the docs, as the last step of this phase.**

Last deliberately: the docs describe the slice as built, which is only known
once the diff has been read. They commit on this branch, so they land with the
slice rather than as a stray commit on `main` afterwards.

**The slice's reasoning goes in the squash commit message, not in the roadmap.**
Write that message as the account of the work — what it does, what it cost, and
what was deliberately left out. It is the only record that cannot drift from the
diff it describes, which is why the roadmap holds one line per step rather than
an essay per step. It grew to 1,300 lines once by holding the essays.

Two files, and the split between them is what keeps either readable. **The
roadmap holds what is true about the *project's progress*; the architecture file
holds what is true about the *system*.** A fact that will still be true after
this slice ships is not roadmap material.

In [`docs/roadmap.md`](../../../docs/roadmap.md), update all of these that moved:

- **Current state** — only if the slice changed what the app *is*: a screen
  gained, a screen's job changed, a line of the inventory moved. Never a
  paragraph narrating the slice.
- **Built** — one line. Leave the commit hash blank; `finish` is what creates it,
  and the author runs that.
- **Not built, and why** — the entries the slice's "deliberately absent" list
  would have held: one sentence of what was left out, one of why. Delete any
  entry this slice built, or settled against for good.
- **Launch checklist**, if a box moved.
- **Long-term remarks** — see below. Most slices add nothing here.
- **Open decisions** — move anything this slice settled out of the list, and add
  anything it opened.
- **Last updated** date.

**Nothing else goes in the roadmap.** Not what was learned, not why an approach
was chosen, not what went wrong on the way. All of that is either a fact about
the system — which belongs in `architecture.md`, under its subsystem — or the
story of the work, which belongs in the commit message.

**In [`docs/architecture.md`](../../../docs/architecture.md), prune before you
add.** In that order, always — the pruning pass is what stops the file growing
by pure accretion, and doing it second turns it into a formality nobody performs.

1. **Delete what this slice made false.** Every section it touched, read for
   claims the diff contradicts.
2. **Delete what has done its job.** An entry earns its place by changing how
   the *next* piece of work goes. Once the thing it was warning about has been
   built, or the decision it explained has been superseded, it is history — and
   git holds history better than a file every session reads.
3. **Then add**, filing each new fact under the subsystem heading it belongs to,
   beside its neighbours. Never append a section named after this slice. If a
   new fact amends an existing entry, rewrite that entry in the present tense
   rather than adding a sentence beginning "Since 6.1…" — a chronology of
   amendments is the thing this structure exists to avoid.

What earns an entry: a gotcha hit along the way, a shortcut taken deliberately,
something left unmapped, a constraint discovered in a payload, a toolchain
behaviour the source does not show. Whether it could be recovered from the code
is not the test; plenty of it could be, given enough reading, and the point is
that the next slice does not have to go looking. The test is whether it makes
later work go differently. If nothing does, write nothing — padding buries the
entries that matter.

Two things that are never entries: restatements of the `AGENTS.md`
non-negotiables, which are already binding, and anything already recorded in
`foundations.md` or `api-football-findings.md`, which are the sources for what
they cover. Link to them instead.

**On "Long-term remarks":** a far higher bar, and a different one. An entry
qualifies only if all three hold:

1. It was **explicitly agreed with the author**. Not inferred, not assumed
   because it seemed sensible while implementing.
2. It **cannot be derived from the code**. If reading the repo would tell you,
   the repo is already the better record.
3. It **outlives the next slice**. It shapes work several steps away, or it
   constrains everything until something specific changes.

Each entry names its own exit: `<remark>, can be resolved when X is
implemented`. That clause is what makes the section prunable — an entry is
removed on the evidence of X existing, rather than on someone's judgement that
it feels stale. An entry nobody can write an exit clause for is not a long-term
remark; it is an open decision, and belongs in that section instead.

Long-term remarks and architecture entries differ deliberately on point 2. An
architecture entry is a convenience — it saves the next slice a read of the
code — so being recoverable from the code does not disqualify it. A long-term
remark constrains work that has not been planned yet, so it has to be something
the code can never tell you.

**Most slices add nothing here.** Adding an entry is close to a decision in its
own right; if it was not discussed with the author, it does not go in.

**Do not plan the next slice in either file.** No task lists, no ordering, no
"first do X then Y". The next slice is scoped when it is asked for, against the
app as it stands then — a plan written now would be written blind and would
quietly become the plan by default. "Not built, and why" is the exception that
proves it: it records what was *declined* and the argument for declining, which
is the opposite of an instruction to build something.

The tell is grammatical: a remark states what *is* true, so it survives being
read a month later. A plan uses imperatives — "add X", "set up Y", "fetch Z" —
and a heading naming the next step is usually a task list about to happen. That
last tell applies to `architecture.md` headings too: they name subsystems, never
slices.

**9. Stop.**

Do not push. **Do not run `/slice finish` — it is the author's, always.** Vercel
builds from `main`, so the `git push` inside that phase *is* the production
deploy; running it would be deploying, which is the one thing this project does
not do unattended. It is also the author's only chance to see the slice work in
the browser first.

Print exactly what the author should check in the browser: the URL, and what
should be on screen if the slice worked. Then wait.

**Expect questions before `finish`.** The author skims `git diff main...HEAD`
themselves and asks about what they find — this is the only independent read the
slice gets, and it is why `finish` is a separate command rather than the tail of
this one. Answer the questions; if one lands, fix it and commit on this branch.
Do not treat the questions as an approval signal or as a cue to run `finish`.

---

## Phase: finish

Merge, push, delete. Nothing else — the slice was finished in `start`.

**Run only when the author asks for it by name.** It pushes `main`, and Vercel
builds from `main`, so this phase deploys to production. Their questions about
the diff are not a request to run it, and neither is their saying the slice looks
right.

### Preconditions

1. On a `slice/*` branch.
2. Working tree is clean. Anything uncommitted means `start` did not finish;
   say so and stop rather than sweeping it into the merge.

### Steps

**1. Merge, push, delete.**

```
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git merge --squash slice/<name>
git commit                                # one readable commit for the whole slice
git push
git branch -D slice/<name>
```

The slice branch is never pushed. It exists so that work in progress can be
committed freely without `main` ever holding a broken state; once the squash
commit lands, it has no further job. Nothing else consumes it — there is no PR
in this flow — so pushing it would only be to delete it again.

`--ff-only` on the pull is deliberate. `main` should only ever move forward by
these squash commits, so if it cannot fast-forward, something has gone wrong and
the merge should stop rather than quietly manufacture a merge commit.

The squash commit message is the only lasting record of the slice, so write it
properly — what the slice does and anything deliberately left out. Neither is
recoverable from the individual commits. No `Co-Authored-By` trailer.

`branch -D`, not `-d`: a squash merge leaves no merge ancestry, so git does not
believe the branch is merged and `-d` refuses it. That refusal is not a warning
worth heeding here — the squash commit on `main` contains every change the
branch made. Only the intermediate commits go, and they are the part that was
never meant to last.

**2. Stop and hand back.**

Report what landed on `main`. The slice is over; do not start the next one.
