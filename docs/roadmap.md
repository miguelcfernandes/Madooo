# Roadmap

Where the project stands and what happens next. Update this as things land —
it is the file that lets a fresh session pick up without the previous
conversation.

How the system *works* is not here. That is
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md), organised by subsystem: read the section
you are about to touch before writing code in it.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-23 (step 21 — the diary by match)

---

## Current state

**There are four leagues, and two of them are being played.** The app runs on
API-Football's Pro tier against `SEASON=2026` with `LEAGUES=39,94,140,135`: the
2026-27 Premier League, which kicks off on 21 August, the Primeira Liga, which
started in August, La Liga, whose opening weekend is 15 August, and Serie A,
whose first round is played over 22–24 August. All four calendars are in the
database — 380 matches, 306, 380 and 380 — and the fixtures with squads are
clickable, with lineups, squads and player statistics. The Premier League's and
Serie A's are not, and will not be until their own opening weekends: 6.2 decided
a card with no squad does not navigate.

That asymmetry is the reason the second league was added before the sync was
scheduled. Until it landed nothing on any screen had been played, so nothing past
`/fixtures` could be exercised at all.

**Which fixtures have squads is now the schedule's answer rather than a fact to
record here.** The scheduled run asks for a team sheet from 45 minutes before
each kickoff, so a league joins the app's populated half on its own opening
weekend with no commit — La Liga's first squads were written by the 17:55 UTC run
on 15 August, 45 minutes after the window for Alaves v Getafe opened and on the
second ask, the first having found the sheet unpublished. Read the current state
from the database rather than from this paragraph.

**A fixture the provider has called off says so.** A postponed or cancelled match
draws POSTPONED or CANCELLED where its kickoff time would go, on the fixture card
and on the match page. The calendar pass already follows the provider's new date
and hour once one is published, so a called-off fixture reappears on the day it
is eventually played. SC Braga vs GIL Vicente, postponed on 16 August, is the
fixture that found it — and the one that later argued for step 20, because under
the matchday pager it went on sitting in Matchday 1 where nobody would look.

**And users can now ask for things.** The top bar carries a labelled "Suggest a
feature" button, opening a dialog with one message box; what is typed there is
stored against the sender's account and read back with `npm run suggestions` from
a laptop. There is no screen for it and no reply — it is a channel to the author,
not a forum — which is what keeps a private, single-user app free of anything to
moderate.

The 2024 judgements are still in the database and no longer on any screen, since
every read filters by season; they were the author's own test data.

**`/fixtures` is a day, not a matchday.** The page shows one calendar day at a
time — every competition at once, cut into a section per league in a stated
popularity order, Premier League first and the Primeira Liga last — under a pager
whose arrows step to the previous and next day that actually have football in
them. A bare address is always today, even when today is empty. A card carries
its matchday where its date used to be, which is what keeps a fixture postponed
out of round 1 and played five weeks later from reading as an orphan on the day
it was finally played.

That retired the league row, the matchday pager and the `madooo-league` cookie
with them, so the app is back to two stores. The national flags survive the
change and now mark the section headings: four 4:3 SVGs in `public/flags/`, and a
league whose country has no file draws the heading exactly as before. A fixture
with a
squad opens onto both matchday squads — each club's starting eleven above its
bench, goalkeeper first, with shirt numbers and positions, each panel headed by
its club's crest — and one without says so instead. The match opens with a card
rather than a title: the competition, ground, date and referee on a strip, over
the two clubs either side of the score. It sits in a responsive app shell whose
four destinations — Fixtures, Players, Teams and Diary — are all built; none is a
placeholder any more.

**And there is a front door.** `/` is the page the design draws: a header
carrying both ways in, a hero beside a mock match card, three features each
showing a piece of the real interface, and a "Free, forever." block over a
GitHub button. It reads nothing — no database, no session — which is what keeps
it the one route that prerenders, so the fixture on it was never played and the
three numbers under "Build a database" are a sample rather than anyone's totals.
It is only ever seen signed out: a visitor who already has a session is
redirected to `/fixtures`, because the sign-in buttons it offers are inert once
there is one. What it claims is now true — the repository carries an MIT licence
and a README, in place of the `create-next-app` boilerplate that had survived
since step 1. The tab carries the app's own mark too: a white M on a black
rounded square, as `favicon.ico` at 16/32/48, `icon.png` and `apple-icon.png`,
which retires the last of that scaffolding.

**The app writes.** Every player on a match page carries three chips — standout,
flop, MVP — and tapping one records a private judgement against that player in
that match; tapping it again clears it. A match has one MVP at most, and
awarding it again moves it. Each panel header counts its own
verdicts, and a "Your verdicts" panel under both benches lists what the match was
judged to be, MVP first. Nothing is shared: the read is filtered to the signed-in
user, so a second account opening the same match sees an unjudged team sheet.

**A judgement can also be words.** A fourth control on every row opens a dialog —
the app's first form, and its first `<dialog>` — and what is typed there is saved
against that player in that match and read back under the row it belongs to. A
note stands on its own: a player can carry one with no tag at all. Clearing the
box and saving takes it away, and takes the whole judgement with it if there was
nothing else on it.

**And the app adds it up.** `/fixtures` opens on four tiles — matches watched
this season, standouts, flops, notes — and every fixture card carries a footer
counting the verdicts and the notes on that match. A match is *watched* once
anything has been recorded against it. Every tally is the signed-in user's own,
so a second account sees four zeroes and a page of empty footers. The tiles are
season-wide and stay put as the day changes, which is what makes them tallies.

**And it can be read back, two ways.** `/diary` is no longer a placeholder. Over
four tiles sits a row of three tabs that live in the URL as `?view=`: **All** and
**With notes** list judgements, newest first, dated by **when they were
written** — agreed explicitly, and the reason the fixture is named on every row.
A note with no tag is an entry too, drawn with a fourth badge in the
informational blue that exists nowhere in the database.

**Matches** lists one row per match instead, dated by kickoff, naming whoever was
made MVP and tallying the standouts, flops and notes beside it. It is the only
list in the app ordered by when a thing happened rather than by when the reader
wrote about it, and it exists because one list of judgements could not be
searched by match: eight verdicts on one game are eight rows that all say the
same fixture. Every list is cut into calendar months with a count against each,
and every row links back to the match.

**And there is a way in to all of them.** `/players` is the season's whole
matchday-squad roster — every player, not only the judged ones — over four tallies
of what the reader has given out. A search box finds any of them as it is typed
in, including a player nobody has ever judged, because the list is held in the
browser rather than asked for a name at a time. A league filter, five sort orders
and a rows-or-cards toggle sit beside it, and **those three are remembered between
visits in `localStorage`** rather than in the URL — the first screen state in the
app that is not in the address bar. Sixty rows are drawn at a time under a "Show
more"; the count in the card's header is always the true one.

**And a way in to every club.** `/teams` is the same directory one level up:
every club that has played this season, with its competition, how many of its
players the reader has judged, the mix of what they gave them, and how many of
its matches they watched. The same four controls as the players index, drawn from
the same sort table and remembered under their own keys — nothing is shared
between the two lists but the vocabulary. No row cap: twenty clubs is not six
hundred players. A club's bar is the three verdicts as a proportion of **each
other** rather than of matches watched, because one match carries eleven of a
club's players and a remainder taken against it would not exist — which is the
reason the club profile still draws no bar at all.

**And so does a club.** `/teams/[id]` opens on the crest at shirt-tile size, the
competition it played in, four tallies of what its players were given, and the
squad — every player who turned out for the club this season, most of them
"Never judged", each row carrying his own split bar and seen count. *Watched*
here means matches of theirs the reader recorded anything in, even where all of
it was about the opponent, which is `/fixtures`' meaning of the word narrowed to
a club. Three ways in: either club in the match page's scoreline, the crest in a
squad panel header, and the club line on a player profile. Back returns to
whichever it was, and to the tab the profile was left on.

**And a player has a profile.** Every name in a squad list, in "Your verdicts",
in the diary and now on the index is a link to one: the club and shirt number he was last
named under, four tallies, a bar splitting his watched matches between the three
verdicts and the ones that got none, and his own diary under a Diary/Notes tab
strip. *Watched* means matches where something was recorded and he was in the
squad, which is what makes the bar's fourth segment read as "watched him and said
nothing". A profile has no single parent, so the way back travels in the URL and
is rebuilt from it rather than echoed. The diary's filters moved onto the same
tab strip.

Every screen renders in light or dark. Light is the default for everyone — the
app no longer follows the operating system — and the top bar's toggle switches
it, remembered across visits. Clerk's own modals follow it too. The chrome is
complete: the last gap in it was the filled button, which had no hover in either
theme and now has one, along with the token the design system was missing for it.

**Every screen in the design is built**, and one has since been rebuilt past it.
That claim was made once before the landing page had a drawing; two arrived
afterwards and 8.4 built it. `/fixtures` is now the one screen that deliberately
departs from its reference images — the drawings show a league row and a matchday
pager, and 20 replaced both. The screenshots are kept as drawn rather than
annotated; this paragraph is the record that they are behind on that screen.

**And the sync now knows what to read without being told.** `npm run sync --
--due` refreshes all four calendars and then asks our own table which finished
matches have not been read yet, which is why the leagues playing different
weekends and different numbers of rounds costs no code at all — the question is
asked per fixture, so the competitions never have to be told apart. A new column
records when a match's detail was last read, and a match stays due until it has
been read six hours past kickoff, which buys one confirming pass over ratings
the provider revises after full time. Nothing throws its way out of a run any
more and every run ends in one summary line, because the thing meant to call
this has nobody watching it.

**And that thing now exists.** A GitHub Actions workflow runs `--due` every
ten minutes from 09:00 to 01:00 UTC, so the deployed app's data no longer
depends on a laptop being open — which is the app's second non-negotiable
finally being true rather than assumed. It writes the production branch,
because that is the one the deployment reads. The season and the leagues are
repository *variables* there rather than secrets, so a fifth league is a field in a
form and no commit; the price is that both now have two homes, `.env.local` and
GitHub, which can disagree.

**And a match no longer waits for full time to become readable.** The scheduled
run asks for a team sheet from about three quarters of an hour before kickoff,
so a fixture becomes openable and judgeable while it is still unplayed — its
card carrying the kickoff time where a score will go, its page carrying both
elevens and both benches with nobody rated yet. A match being played says
**LIVE** rather than showing a score, because these pages never poll and a
scoreline drawn at kick-off plus ten would sit there going stale; the score
arrives when the match is over and the number stops moving. Those three states —
unplayed, in play, finished — are now distinguishable at a glance on the
fixtures page, which they were not.

**And a kickoff time now says when *you* sit down.** The time a fixture card
draws in place of a score, and the one the match page draws under the same
condition, are formatted in the reader's own timezone rather than in English
football's. Nothing else moved: the day a fixture is filed under and the diary's
month headings are still the competition's calendar, which has one right answer
for everybody. No zone label beside the number and no setting to
turn it off — it is simply the reader's clock.

Auth is no longer provisional. `madooo.app` runs Clerk's production instance,
signing in through Madooo's own Google OAuth client and sending mail from
`notifications@madooo.app`; the development instance survives on the laptop and
on Vercel's preview environment. What remains of the launch checklist is the
`npm audit` judgement.

**Nor is the database.** `madooo.app` reads a production Neon branch holding
only season 2026, filled from API-Football rather than copied from development,
and the scheduled sync writes to it. Preview deployments and the laptop keep the
development branch — which still carries 2024 and the judgements made against it
— and nothing fills that one on a timer any more; `npm run sync -- --due` does,
by hand, when a preview needs current football.

**And a click now answers.** Three things were taking a second or two out of
every navigation, none of them the queries. The functions ran in `iad1` while the
database sits in `eu-west-2`, so the six sequential round trips `/fixtures` then
made crossed the Atlantic on every page; they run in `lhr1` now, and step 20 has
since cut that chain to two. `requireDbUser()` asked Clerk's Backend
API for the signed-in user on every render and wrote the row back — it reads the
row instead, and only asks Clerk when there is no row to read. And no route had a
`loading.tsx`, so a click left the previous page on screen until the server
finished; every route has one now, which also turned on the `<Link>` prefetching
that Next withholds from dynamic routes without one.

- Next 16.2.12 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19.2.4, Tailwind 4, TypeScript
- Prisma 7.9.1 against Neon Postgres, via the `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter
- Clerk 7.x for auth, with Google and email/password enabled, on a production
  instance bound to `madooo.app`
- Pushed to `github.com:miguelcfernandes/Madooo`, now on a `slice/*` branch flow
  squash-merged into `main`
- Deployed on Vercel from `main`, built with `prisma generate && next build`;
  Production reads the production Neon branch, Preview the development one.
  [`vercel.json`](../vercel.json) pins the functions to `lhr1`, the region both
  Neon branches are in
- `scripts/verify_api.py` proves the API works; raw payloads sit in `scratch/`
  (gitignored) and are what the schema was designed against
- `npm run db:check` proves the database layer works end to end
- `npm run sync -- --due` fills the database from API-Football with whatever
  needs reading, and `-- --round N` with a named matchday; `npm run db:seed-teams`
  writes the club codes and colours the provider does not publish; `npm test`
  runs Vitest over the mapper, the selection policy and the pages' pure helpers
- Visual designs exist in a Claude Design project, handed off into
  [`design/`](design/): [`foundations.md`](design/foundations.md) is the token
  set and the rules around it, with `colour.png` and `type-and-space.png` as its
  reference sheets and [`screenshots/`](design/screenshots/) showing the
  fixtures page, the match page, the diary, the player profile, the players
  index, the team profile, the teams index and the landing page as intended —
  all of them at desktop width only.
  The tokens are now CSS, in
  [`src/app/globals.css`](../src/app/globals.css)
- Archivo and JetBrains Mono come from `next/font/google`; the Material Symbols
  subset is committed and refreshed by `npm run icons`
- `.env.local` holds `API_FOOTBALL_KEY`, `SEASON`, `LEAGUES`, `DATABASE_URL`,
  `DATABASE_URL_DEV` and four Clerk variables — the development instance's test
  keys, which are what a laptop must use; it carries no `DATABASE_TARGET`, so
  everything run there hits development unless the variable is put in front of
  one command. `.env.example` documents the full set and where each copy lives
- [`.github/workflows/sync.yml`](../.github/workflows/sync.yml) runs the sync on
  a timer against the production branch, out of two repository secrets
  (`DATABASE_URL`, `API_FOOTBALL_KEY`) and two repository variables (`SEASON`,
  `LEAGUES`)

## Build order

Each step ends with something runnable and a commit. Do not run ahead.

Steps 6 to 8 are cut into slices, each its own branch and squash-merge. The
designs are what cut them: the sidebar asked for four destinations where the
roadmap had three. **Every slice owns its own empty state** — what its screen
says when it has nothing to show is part of the slice, not a later pass.

Steps 9 to 13 and 15 are not screens. They are what stands between a working app
and a launched one: real current data, a sync that runs without a laptop, a
database of its own to run into, and the last of the accounts to buy. All of them
have landed. What is left of launching is step 12, which is a checklist rather
than a build.

- [x] **0 — Verify the data source.** Done; see
      [`api-football-findings.md`](api-football-findings.md).
- [x] **1 — Scaffold.** App scaffolded and on GitHub.
- [x] **2 — Database and schema.** Neon project, Prisma schema, first migration.
      Verified by `npm run db:check`.
- [x] **3 — Sync job.** Pulls the season's fixtures in one request and hydrates
      a round from `/fixtures/lineups` and `/fixtures/players`. Verified by
      `npm test` and by reading the rows.
- [x] **4 — Deploy to Vercel.** Live, with `/` reading fixtures from Neon at
      request time so the deployment proves the database path and not just the
      hosting.
- [x] **5 — Auth.** Clerk wired up, with Google and email/password, signed in
      through a modal on the landing page. `/` is public and the fixture list
      moved to `/dashboard`, which shows the signed-in user's email. The `User`
      row is created on first sight.
- [x] **6 — The core loop.** Pick a match, see both squads, tag players
      MVP/STANDOUT/FLOP, and have it persist.
  - [x] **6.1 — App shell.** Done. The sidebar, top bar and shared design
        tokens. `/dashboard` became `/fixtures` inside an `(app)` route group,
        with Players, Teams and Diary as siblings behind placeholders, and the
        signed-in identity moved into the sidebar's foot. The search field the
        design draws in the bar was deliberately left out — a box that does
        nothing is worse than no box — and **search has since been settled the
        other way: it belongs to the screens that have something to search.**
        `/players` and `/teams` each carry their own box in their filter row,
        where it sits beside the filters it works with and can say what it is
        searching. The top bar shipped with the theme toggle and, below `md`,
        the menu button, and this entry used to say nothing further was coming
        to it. Two things since have: a **GitHub mark** beside the toggle in
        8.1, linking to the repository, because the landing page could be read
        as open source and the signed-in app could not; and the **suggestion
        box** on the left in 19. Both were argued the same way — the bar is
        where they belong precisely because nothing in it navigates — and the
        mark was built at the sidebar's foot first and rejected there, since as
        a labelled row it read as a fifth destination. A knowing departure from
        the reference images, twice.
  - [x] **6.1b — Responsive shell.** Done. The sidebar becomes an off-canvas
        drawer below `md`. Nothing at `md` and above changed. The rules it was
        written against are now a `### Responsive` section in `foundations.md`,
        which had none.
  - [x] **6.2 — The fixtures page.** Done. Fixture cards with venue, score and
        crest chips. A match with no squad rows says "No squad yet" and does not
        navigate. The stat tiles and the per-card verdict counts are not here —
        they are 6.6, deliberately last. This entry used to describe a league row
        and a matchday pager, with the matchday in the URL so the page stays a
        server component; **20 replaced both with a day pager** and the URL now
        carries a date. What survives unchanged is the reason the state is in the
        URL at all.
  - [x] **6.3 — Match page.** Done. Both squads, read-only: each club's starting
        eleven above its bench, ordered goalkeeper-first by a pure helper rather
        than by the database, with shirt numbers and positions. The header
        carries the scoreline and a back link to the matchday it was opened from.
        Positions read `GK`/`DEF`/`MID`/`FWD`, not the designs' `RB`/`CB`/`AM` —
        agreed explicitly, because the finer position is in no provider response;
        see [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#a-position-is-one-of-four-letters-and-the-designs-ask-for-more).
        Deliberately absent, all of it 6.4's and 6.6's: the three verdict buttons
        and the note button on every row, the verdict count in each panel header,
        and the "Your verdicts" summary panel the screenshots show below the
        benches. Player names were not links either; 7.2 made them so.
  - [x] **6.3b — The scoreline card.** Done, against a redrawn reference and out
        of order — it landed after 7.2. The header stops being a title and
        becomes a card: a strip carrying the competition, the ground, the date
        and the referee, over the two clubs either side of the score, each with a
        40px crest mark. Every squad panel header gained its club's crest, which
        **removed** the orphaned-bench special case rather than adding one. The
        venue and referee were already synced and already arriving on the page —
        this slice changed no query, no schema and no sync. It cost the token set
        one new type role, `text-score`, and the icon subset two glyphs. The
        referee renders as the provider spells it, `J. Gillett`, not the mock's
        "Jarred Gillett". Deliberately absent: the reference's finer positions,
        still `GK`/`DEF`/`MID`/`FWD` for 6.3's reason.
  - [x] **6.4 — Tagging.** Done. Three chips on every squad row, a Server Action
        writing `Judgement`, and tapping the active chip clears it. MVP transfers
        rather than duplicating — the rule is now in
        [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md). The panel
        header counts and the "Your verdicts" panel came with it, since all three
        read the same judgements. Below `md` the chips drop to their own line at
        40px, which is the narrow-width decision the reference screens have no
        drawing for. Deliberately absent: the fourth button the screenshots draw
        on each row, `edit_note`, which is 6.5's — and links on the summary's
        player names, which are 7.2's.
  - [x] **6.5 — Notes.** Done. A borderless `edit_note` button on every row
        opens a native `<dialog>`; `setNote` writes the text, and saving an empty
        box is how a note is deleted. The note reads back under the row, and
        appears there the moment it is saved — the note line and the button that
        writes it are one client island, which is what lets `useOptimistic` cover
        both. Deliberately absent: the note is not in the "Your verdicts" panel
        and not in the panel header counts, because a note is not a verdict and
        the reference screens show neither.
  - [x] **6.6 — Counts.** Done. The four season stat tiles and a footer strip on
        every fixture card. "Watched" became a query over judgements rather than
        a column — the open decision it needed is settled and gone from the list
        below. The per-card tallies ride the query that was already fetching the
        cards, as a filtered relation beside its unfiltered `_count`. Plurals are
        real, unlike in the reference screenshot. The tiles were the last thing
        step 6 had to resolve at narrow width without a drawing. This entry once
        predicted that step 7's screens would have no drawing at all; every one
        of them arrived with a desktop drawing, and the narrow-width remark
        stayed for the opposite reason — the drawings are desktop-only.
- [x] **7 — Diary, players and teams.** Done, in five slices. Queries over what
      step 6 wrote, plus the two destinations the sidebar adds. What the five
      have in common is worth stating once: three of them are **directories
      rather than diaries** — they list every player, every club, judged or not —
      and none of them carries a verdict control, because the place to change a
      verdict is the match it was given in. Every screen's numbers had to be
      *defined* rather than copied off its drawing, which is how *watched* came
      to mean one thing across four scopes.
  - [x] **7.1 — Diary.** Done, and grouped by **month** rather than by match,
        which is what the reference screenshots turned out to draw. Ordered by
        `Judgement.createdAt`; the schema's `@@index([userId, createdAt])` has
        been waiting for this query since step 2. `StatTiles` became generic over
        its key union so `/fixtures` and `/diary` share one set of markup.
        Deliberately absent: links on the player names, which are 7.2's, and a
        pager — a season's entries are bounded by how much one person typed, and
        the design draws none.
  - [x] **7.2 — Player profile.** Done, and the first screen with a desktop
        drawing whose numbers had to be defined rather than copied: the
        reference shows 14 watched against a split of 6+9+1+4. *Watched* was
        agreed to mean matches where the user recorded anything and the player
        was in the squad — `/fixtures`' own meaning, narrowed to one player —
        which makes the remainder mean "watched him and said nothing" and makes
        the bar fill exactly. The subtitle reads `MID`, not the drawing's
        "Attacking midfielder", for 6.3's reason. `?from=` carries the way back,
        since a profile is opened from four places and a server component cannot
        call `history.back()`. The diary's filter row moved onto the underline
        tab strip this slice introduced, which cost `foundations.md` a rule
        saying when each of the two tab kinds applies. Deliberately absent: no
        verdict controls — a profile reads a season back, and the place to change
        a verdict is the match it was given in.
  - [x] **7.3 — Players index.** Done, and it is a **directory rather than a
        diary** — the list is every player with a squad row this season, most of
        whom have nothing on them. That was a change of scope made during
        planning, and it took the design's first stat tile with it: "TRACKED"
        counted judged players, which stopped describing the list, so the row is
        MVPs / Standouts / Flops / Notes and the subtitle names the league rather
        than a number. Two desktop drawings arrived with the slice, which is why
        the standing remark below no longer claims 7.3 has none.

        The slice's own decisions, none of them drawn: the three controls are
        **preferences and live in `localStorage`**, not the URL, which made this
        the app's first client-rendered list and costs a default-first paint; the
        whole roster ships to the browser, because that is what makes search
        reach an unjudged player without a round trip; and only 60 rows are
        drawn at once, since ~600 would stutter on every keystroke — a control
        the reference does not have. It also cost the app its first raw query.
        Deliberately absent: no verdict controls, for 7.2's reason, and no
        server-side search — see the open decision below.
  - [x] **7.4 — Team profile.** Done, and a **directory** like 7.3 rather than a
        diary: every player with a squad row for the club this season, most of
        them never judged. A desktop drawing arrived with the slice, and like
        7.2's its numbers had to be defined rather than copied — every row draws
        `N judged` equal to `N seen` while the bars are part-filled, which no
        single definition satisfies. What was agreed: *watched* is matches of
        theirs the reader recorded anything in, so one word keeps one meaning
        across three scopes, and it needs one `some` clause where a player's
        needs two, because a club playing is a fact about `Match`'s own columns.
        Each row's bar is a proportion of **that player's own seen count**,
        identical to a players-index row, so grey still reads "watched him and
        said nothing".

        The slice's own decisions: the squad list is the players index's row,
        extracted so the two cannot drift — the subtitle is all that differs,
        and this screen puts what he has been judged where the index puts his
        club. The header's crest is 64px to match the shirt tile a player
        profile puts in the same slot, which cost `CrestChip` a third size and
        `foundations.md` an exception for its letters. `backLink` learned both
        profiles as origins and took its fallback from the caller. Deliberately
        absent: no verdict controls, for 7.2's reason; no search or sort over
        twenty-odd rows; no team-level split bar, since one match can carry
        eleven verdicts and the remainder would mean nothing.

        Three ways in, not the two first agreed: the scoreline's clubs were
        added on sight, which cost the match page's `<h1>` its shape. The
        arrangement moved out of the heading and beside it, because a link
        inside an `aria-hidden` subtree is reachable by keyboard and absent from
        the accessibility tree at once. Deliberately still absent: **no link
        from the fixture card**, whose whole card is already a link, so a club
        inside it would be a nested anchor.
  - [x] **7.5 — Teams index.** Done, and a **directory** like 7.3 and 7.4: every
        club that has played this season, most of them never judged. Two desktop
        drawings arrived with the slice and settled the shape against this
        entry's own prediction — it said none of what made 7.3 expensive would be
        needed, and the drawings show the whole filter row. Search and the three
        `localStorage` preferences are in; only the row cap stayed out, because
        twenty clubs is not six hundred players and a cap that never triggers is
        a control that does nothing.

        Its numbers had to be defined rather than copied, for the third slice
        running. *Seen* is `teamTotals`' *watched* unchanged, so one word now
        keeps one meaning across four scopes, and it is asked of every club at
        once in two `groupBy`s rather than twenty counts. **`N players` is how
        many distinct players of theirs the reader has judged** — the drawing
        leaves the phrase ambiguous and contradicts it on one row. The split bar
        is the decision 7.4 refused: the drawing's is a proportion of matches
        watched, which is exactly the shape that overruns its track once five of
        a club's players are tagged in one fixture. **Agreed instead that a
        club's bar is the mix of the three verdicts and nothing else** — always
        full width, so length carries no information there and colour does, with
        *how much* left to the `N seen` beside it.

        The slice's own decisions: the five sorts, the layout type, the search
        normaliser and the league parser were **extracted into one module both
        indexes read**, since a club is ranked on the same seven numbers as a
        player; the storage keys stay per screen, because the two lists are
        narrowed and sorted independently. Clubs are read from `Match` rather
        than `MatchSquad`, which is what keeps a club whose lineup was never
        published in the directory and what makes a row's league non-nullable.
        Deliberately absent: no stat tiles, which the drawing also omits and
        which would count the reader's own season over a list that is not about
        it; no verdict controls, for 7.2's reason; and the header keeps its
        directory sentence rather than the drawing's "You have judged N teams so
        far", which would describe something other than the list beneath it.
- [x] **8 — Chrome.** In the design, needed by nothing above it. 8.2 was dropped
      rather than built — search settled onto the screens themselves — so the
      step closes on three children, and with it the last of the screen work.
  - [x] **8.1 — Dark-mode toggle.** Done, and taken out of order on purpose:
        it puts every screen through a second theme while there are three of
        them rather than a dozen. The moon icon in the top bar, light-first for
        everyone, remembered in `localStorage` and restored before first paint.
        The landing page came onto tokens with it, and Clerk's appearance
        variables were pointed at ours.
  - [x] **8.3 — The filled button's missing hover step.** One semantic token,
        `--surface-inverse-hover`, and both filled buttons onto it — the landing
        page's "Create an account" and 6.5's "Save note", neither of which had a
        hover state.

        What unlocked it was reading the rule properly rather than finding a
        colour. "Surfaces darken one step" has nothing below black, but the dark
        theme has always *lightened* on hover — `--surface` to `--surface-alt` —
        so the rule means one step along the ramp away from the page, and an
        inverse surface inverts that direction like everything else about it.
        Both values were already in the ramp; no hex was invented, which was the
        whole difficulty. Press stays `translateY(1px)` with no second colour
        step, because the step below it lands on `--text-muted`'s grey and reads
        as disabled. The selected pill tab and segmented button fill with
        `--surface-inverse` too and were deliberately left out: they are selected
        states, not buttons. See
        [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#hovering-a-filled-surface-and-hovering-a-tint-were-resolved-differently).
  - [x] **8.4 — The landing page.** Done, from two drawings that arrived long
        after the screen they replace. `/` had been a centred heading, a
        paragraph and two buttons since step 5; it is now a marketing page — a
        header, a hero beside a mock match card, three features, an open-source
        block and a footer.

        The whole of it is a constant, which is the point: `/` is the one route
        that prerenders, and it stays that way by reading nothing. So the fixture
        is invented and the three totals are a sample, agreed as such rather than
        dressed up as live. The mock is assembled from the app's own objects but
        not from `SquadPanel`, whose types would drag Prisma onto a page that
        must never reach it, and it draws `FWD`/`MID`/`DEF` rather than the
        drawing's `RW`/`CM`/`CB` for 6.3's reason — which binds harder here,
        since advertising a detail the product cannot render is advertising the
        mock. The badge that reads a verdict back was extracted out of
        `JudgementEntry` so the two screens cannot draw it differently; the
        landing page's fifth key, `UNRATED`, stays in its own file, because the
        app has no such state.

        It cost the icon subset two glyphs, `lock` — since replaced by
        `lock_open`, an open padlock being the truer mark for a tag reading
        "Free and open source" — and `code`, since dropped when the GitHub
        button took the octocat, and
        `foundations.md` a description of the Tag — a 24px pill it had listed a
        height for and never defined. The header wraps to two lines below ~360px
        rather than shrinking its buttons, which is the narrow decision the
        drawings have no answer for.

        **The page claims "free and open source", so the repository had to
        become it**: an MIT `LICENSE`, and a README replacing the
        `create-next-app` boilerplate that had been there since step 1.
        Deliberately absent: no call to action in the hero, no theme toggle —
        the drawings have neither, and the toggle belongs to the app shell.
- [x] **9 — Move onto the paid tier and the current season.** Done. Pro,
      `SEASON=2026`, and the 2026-27 calendar in the database. **The season
      switch cost one variable in two places and no code at all**, which is the
      first real test of the non-negotiable that exists to make that true.

      What did cost code was everything the free tier had been quietly shaping.
      The client's 6.5s request interval was sized for 10 requests a minute and
      said so in its own comment; it now derives itself from the per-minute
      ceiling the response headers carry, so the next plan change needs no code
      either. `verify_api.py` probed only seasons flagged for lineup coverage,
      which can never include one that has not kicked off — the same
      coverage-is-not-entitlement trap as before, sprung from the other side, and
      it had recommended `SEASON=2025`. And two promoted clubs, Coventry and Hull
      City, had no code or colour in the identity seed.

      **This replaced the backfill, which was step 9 and is deleted.** That step
      would have spent 33 rounds' worth of requests hydrating the rest of 2024, a
      season the app has now stopped reading. Hydration did not move to this step
      either: on 11 August the live season had no played match to hydrate, so
      there was nothing to select and nothing to test a selection against. It is
      step 10's, entire.

      Two things learned that were not expected. The Pro subscription renews
      **monthly**, where the free tier ran a year — a lapse three weeks into the
      season would cut the app off mid-season, so it is now in the checklist. And
      the live fixture list is **provisional**: only the first five rounds carry
      real kickoff times, the rest sitting at a placeholder Saturday 14:00 until
      broadcast selections move them. See
      [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#a-live-seasons-calendar-is-provisional-and-a-closed-ones-is-not).
- [x] **10 — Schedule the sync.** Done, and with a fortnight to spare on the
      season it was racing. The app's second non-negotiable assumes a scheduled
      job writes into Postgres. It did not exist — `npm run sync` was a CLI the
      author ran by hand, so the deployed app's data was only ever as fresh as
      the last time a laptop was open — and **the season starting on 21 August
      turned it from the largest piece of unbuilt work into the one with a date
      on it.**

      Four things were settled in planning, and the first of them settles the
      question the step was stuck on. **The schedule fetches a lineup when it is
      announced, not only after full time**, and a round pointer cannot express
      "kicks off in ninety minutes" — so selection had to become per-fixture,
      which is what dissolves the per-league problem step 11 opened and step 13
      made worse. The trigger is **GitHub Actions**, not Vercel Cron, so the API
      key stays out of the deployed environment. The cadence is **every 10
      minutes, 09:00–01:00 UTC** — a Neon decision rather than a quota one,
      since compute suspends after five minutes idle. And **standings are out of
      scope**, with no season assertion either.
  - [x] **10.1 — Selection, and a CLI safe to leave alone.** Done, post-match
        only. `--due` asks our own table which finished matches have not been
        read yet and needs no answer to "which round is current"; `Match.hydratedAt`
        records when the detail endpoints were last read, and one predicate —
        `hydratedAt IS NULL OR hydratedAt < kickoff + 6 hours` — covers "never
        read", "read too early to be final" and "stop", terminating with no
        attempt counter. A fourteen-day window is the give-up rule rather than
        just a bound. The whole policy is
        [`hydration.ts`](../src/lib/hydration.ts), which imports nothing and is
        entirely under Vitest.

        The unattended half cost as much as the selection: nothing throws its
        way out of a run any more, the quota pre-flight clamps where it used to
        refuse, and one summary line ends every run. `--due --dry-run` reports
        the selection for nothing. `--round` stays as the repair tool — it
        reaches a match the window has dropped.

        Two things the payloads could not settle and the documentation had to.
        The captured fixture lists contain only `FT` and `NS`, so the rest of
        the status vocabulary is written down rather than observed, and the test
        asserts only that every status the payloads *do* contain is classified.
        And `AWD`/`WO` are the trap: a match awarded 3–0 is over and never had a
        team sheet. Deliberately absent: no workflow, which is 10.2's, and
        nothing pre-match, which is 10.3's.
  - [x] **10.2 — The workflow.** Done, and it closes the non-negotiable: the
        deployed app's data no longer depends on a laptop.
        [`.github/workflows/sync.yml`](../.github/workflows/sync.yml) runs `--due`
        every ten minutes, 09:00–01:00 UTC, on two secrets and two
        *variables* — `SEASON` and `LEAGUES` are configuration and nothing about
        them is sensitive, so the fourth league stays a field in a form. It
        writes the **development** branch, following the deployment onto it;
        syncing production while Vercel reads development would have left the app
        exactly as stale as no schedule at all. `concurrency` is the lock, since
        a Postgres advisory lock is scoped to a session and Neon's pooler hands
        sessions out per transaction.

        No runtime code: it checks out, `npm ci`, `db:generate`, and runs the CLI
        10.1 had already made safe to leave alone. The generate step is not
        optional — the Prisma client is gitignored build output and there is no
        `postinstall`. `npm test` is deliberately absent, since the suite reads
        payloads from a gitignored `scratch/`, and so is `prisma migrate deploy`.

        Verified before merging by cloning the branch to a fresh directory and
        running the job's three commands with only its four variables in the
        environment and no `.env.local` — which is the part that could not be
        proved any other way, since a workflow only runs from the default branch.
        `workflow_dispatch` takes `round`, `league` and `dry_run`, putting the
        `--round N` repair tool on a button. Deliberately absent: any narrower
        fixtures fetch, and any keepalive for the 60-day inactivity disable.
  - [x] **10.3 — Announced lineups.** Done, and verified against real football:
        Academico Viseu v Santa Clara was openable with both team sheets fifteen
        minutes before it kicked off. `isLineupDue` sits beside `isDue` as a
        second predicate — pending status, fewer than two `MatchLineup` rows,
        inside a window that opens before kickoff and closes at **full time**
        rather than at kickoff, which is what covers a sheet published late. It
        fetches `/fixtures/lineups` alone, so it writes no provisional
        statistics, which is the only reason it is safe to run mid-match.

        **The probe changed the design, which is what it was for.** The lead was
        going to be 90 minutes; timed probes found the sheet absent at T−29 and
        complete at T−18, so it is **45**, and the old number would have spent
        five empty requests per fixture. The author's recollection of the
        provider's own 20-40 minute claim is what prompted the extra reading
        that caught it — the scheduled probes jumped straight over the window.
        Also settled: `/fixtures/players` is empty pre-kickoff, so one endpoint
        is right; sheets arrive complete for both clubs at once, so counting
        lineups is sufficient; and nothing in the fixture payload flags that a
        sheet exists, so a time window is the only trigger available.

        **Two bugs only live data could find.** A real team sheet named a player
        with a **null id**, which failed the whole fixture — `buildSquad` now
        drops that slot. And the partial write left two lineup rows with no
        players, which marked the fixture complete to its own predicate and made
        it permanently unopenable; the team sheets are now written **last**, as
        the completion marker. Both are in
        [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#sync-and-the-provider-boundary) and
        [`api-football-findings.md`](api-football-findings.md).

        Rendering needed almost nothing — `FixtureCard` already keyed openable
        off squad rows, and both scorelines already fell back to the kickoff
        time. What it did surface is that opening a match *in progress* was
        newly reachable and drew a live 0-0 as a finished draw, which is what
        the live badge below fixes.
- [x] **11 — A second league.** Done, and deliberately **before** step 10 rather
      than after it. The Primeira Liga's season was already under way while the
      Premier League's had not started, so it was the only way to put played
      football — hydrated squads, real statistics, clickable cards — on the
      screens before 21 August. Everything downstream of `/fixtures` had been
      unexercisable against live data until it landed.

      **It cost one environment variable and a parameter**, which is the second
      real test of the non-negotiable that promised exactly that. `LEAGUES=39,94`
      is read by the sync alone; every page discovers its leagues from our own
      `League` table, so no page and no Vercel environment had to be told. The
      schema needed no migration — `Match.leagueId` and its index had been there
      since step 2 and were simply never used.

      What did cost code was `/fixtures`, whose four queries had all been scoped
      by season alone. Two leagues both label a round `"Regular Season - 1"`, so
      grouping across them collapsed two matchdays three weeks apart into one
      pager row. The league became a slug in the URL, the league row became real
      links rather than the placeholder it had been since 6.2, and back links
      learned to carry it. `seasonTotals` deliberately did **not** take a league:
      the tiles count the reader's whole season, as `/diary` does.

      Two things the probe settled that had been assumptions. Entitlement is per
      league as well as per season — the same coverage-is-not-entitlement rule,
      on a new axis — and it had only ever been checked for league 39. And the
      provider calls the competition **Primeira Liga**, not Liga Portugal, which
      is what `League.name` holds and therefore what the URL slug is built from.
- [ ] **12 — Launch checklist.** Not code, and not to be left to launch day.
      Each of these was recorded as an open decision before it was clear they are
      simply tasks with a date on them:
  - [x] **Clerk production instance.** Done, ahead of the "one to two weeks
        before launch" it was written for, because the domain was already live.
        Bound to `madooo.app`, with Madooo's own Google OAuth client and the
        five CNAMEs at Namecheap; see
        [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#auth-and-routing).
  - [ ] **Re-evaluate the `npm audit` warnings.** High-severity issues in
        `postcss` and `sharp`, both transitive dependencies of Next itself,
        whose suggested fix downgrades Next to 9. To be judged before launch,
        not "fixed" — see [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)'s "Known noise".
  - [ ] **Confirm the API-Football subscription renews.** Pro is billed
        **monthly** and the current term ends 2026-09-11, three weeks into the
        season. The free tier ran a year at a time, so nothing in the project has
        ever had to think about this. A lapse stops the app reaching the live
        season while the season is being played.
- [x] **13 — A third league, La Liga.** Done, and it cost **one environment
      variable and a sync run** — no parameter this time, because step 11 had
      already built `--league` on both the sync and the probe. That is the third
      test of the first non-negotiable and the cheapest of them: the second
      league needed `/fixtures` rewritten, and this one needed no product code at
      all. Every file it touched outside the seed table and one test was a
      sentence that said "two leagues" and now says three.

      **It landed with nothing hydrated**, because La Liga's 2026-27 season had
      not kicked off: 380 fixtures and 20 clubs in the database and every card
      reading "No squad yet". That state ended on its own on 15 August, without a
      commit, which is the point — step 10's schedule reaches a league's opening
      weekend by itself, and this step never had to say when.

      What the probe settled: league 140 is entitled for 2026 despite every
      coverage flag on that season being **false**, which is the plainest
      instance of coverage-is-not-entitlement the project has caught; the
      provider calls it **La Liga**, not Primera División, so the slug is
      `la-liga`; and its round labels match the other two, which is what let
      `rounds.ts` parse a third competition unchanged.

      A test that had been waiting for this asserted `leagueSlug('Primera
      División')`, on the stated expectation that the third league would arrive
      carrying that name. It did not. The assertion is still worth keeping as a
      test of the normaliser's diacritic handling, but it now says so rather
      than claiming to be about La Liga.
- [x] **14 — The kickoff time on the reader's clock.** Done, and scoped
      deliberately narrow. Every date in the app was formatted in a fixed
      `Europe/London`, which is right for a matchday and wrong for the one date
      that is about the reader rather than the season. `kickoffTime` now takes a
      zone; the other four formatters do not, and the line between them is in
      [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#the-seasons-calendar-is-pinned-to-london-a-kickoff-time-is-the-readers).

      **The server cannot know a reader's zone, so this is the app's first client
      island that is not about screen state.** `KickoffTime` reads the browser's
      through `useSyncExternalStore`, which is the two indexes' hook used for a
      value that is not a preference — the server snapshot is "London", so the
      two renders agree and the first paint is the English time before it swaps.
      That cost was accepted rather than paid down: the alternative is a timezone
      cookie set in the head, still wrong on a first visit and charged to every
      request.

      What the browser check caught that a test could not: the visible time and
      the match page's `sr-only` heading are two renderings of the same kickoff,
      and localising only the first would have read 20:30 into a screen reader
      beside a 21:30 on screen. Also settled in planning: **no zone label** — the
      score slot is four characters wide — and **no setting**, since a reader who
      wants English kickoff times is not a reader this app has.

      Deliberately absent: the locale does not follow the zone, so a reader in
      New York gets `20:00` and not `8:00 pm`; and nothing else localises.
- [x] **15 — The production database.** Done, and it cost **three environment
      variables, a migrate and a sync** — no product code at all.
      [`src/lib/env.ts`](../src/lib/env.ts) had been built for this since step 2,
      so the whole cutover was configuration, which is the fourth demonstration
      of the first non-negotiable and the cheapest since the third league.

      **Production was filled from API-Football, not copied from development**,
      and that turned out to be the decision the step was really about. The
      development branch still carries 380 Premier League matches from **2024**,
      left from the free-tier era, and 222 of its 224 judgements hang off them.
      A copy would have moved all of it onto the live site. A fresh sync cost 28
      requests — three calendars and the thirteen matches season 2026 had
      actually played — because the Premier League had not kicked off yet. The
      result is a branch holding season 2026 and nothing else.

      **The sync moved with it, in the same sitting**, which is the failure the
      architecture file had been warning about since step 4: a deployment
      reading a branch nothing syncs looks like a season that stopped rather
      than like an error. Vercel's Production environment and
      [`sync.yml`](../.github/workflows/sync.yml) are now the only two places
      `DATABASE_TARGET` exists, and they have to agree.

      **Nothing fills the development branch on a timer any more.** Agreed
      deliberately: a second scheduled leg would have kept two Neon computes
      awake all day, and Neon — not API-Football's quota — is what bounds the
      schedule. So a preview deployment shows whatever development last saw, and
      `npm run sync -- --due` from a laptop is what refreshes it.

      **What filling an empty database caught that a full one had hidden:**
      API-Football renamed team 224 from `Guimaraes` to `Vitória SC` at some
      point after the seed table was written. Development never noticed, because
      its `code` and `colour` had been written while the old name still matched
      and the sync does not touch those columns. Production skipped the club and
      drew a colourless chip. The name guard did exactly its job — it painted
      nothing rather than painting the wrong club — and the fix was the table,
      not the guard.

      Deliberately not done: the 2024 season stays on development. It is dev data
      on a dev branch, production never sees it, and removing it is not what this
      step was for.
- [x] **16 — The delay on every click.** Done, in one slice of three parts, and
      the first thing it settled is that **the queries were never the problem**.
      They were timed before anything was changed: all five of `/fixtures`' reads
      come back in 283–351ms from a laptop, and the shapes step 7 argued about —
      the `groupBy`, the `DISTINCT ON`, the four parallel counts — are doing what
      they were written to do. Nothing in `src/lib/` was touched.

      What was wrong sat either side of them. **The functions ran in `iad1`**,
      Vercel's default and never a choice, while both Neon branches are in
      `eu-west-2`; a page making six sequential round trips paid roughly 80ms of
      Atlantic for each, against 15–17ms from Europe. That is the whole reason
      production felt slower than a laptop, which had read as an app problem
      throughout. `vercel.json` is three lines and fixes it.

      **`requireDbUser()` rebuilt the signed-in user on every render**, through
      `currentUser()` — a fetch to Clerk's Backend API, 190–230ms, which their own
      docs advise against — plus a write, to reproduce a row unchanged since
      signup. `auth()` already carries the Clerk id in the verified cookie, so the
      common path is now one indexed read and the slow path runs once per user
      ever.

      **And nothing said a click had registered.** No route had a `loading.tsx`,
      so the previous page stayed up, untouched, until the server finished. Six
      fallbacks now cover the group. The second effect was the one worth finding:
      Next does not prefetch a dynamic route unless a loading file exists, so
      every `<Link>` in a `force-dynamic` app had been prefetching nothing.

      Two things this needed that were already written down: `foundations.md`
      forbids the shimmer a skeleton usually carries, and `architecture.md` had
      flagged the shell's `await` as something to move behind Suspense "if it ever
      matters" — it was exactly what would have kept the fallback from showing.

      Deliberately not done: `use cache`, and Neon's scale-to-zero. Both are in
      Open decisions.
- [x] **17 — A postponed fixture says so.** Found by running a sync rather than by
      looking for it: SC Braga vs GIL Vicente had been `PST` since 16 August, and
      both screens drew it as a match about to be played. Neither did so on
      purpose — both reached the kickoff time by way of "no goals recorded", which
      is as true of a postponement as of an unplayed fixture.

      **Two thirds of what was wanted already existed**, which is why this was a
      rendering change and nothing else. The calendar pass writes `kickoff` and
      `status` on every `--due` run, so a new date and hour land within ten minutes
      of the provider publishing them; and grouping is by `round`, so a fixture
      keeps its matchday however far its date moves. Only the badge was missing.

      **`PST` and `CANC` only.** They are the two that mean *not played at all*.
      `ABD` has a team sheet and a partial result, and `AWD` and `WO` carry a real
      score, so badging those three would put a word where a result belongs — a
      decision rather than a tidy-up, if it is ever wanted.

      **The naming is the part worth keeping.** `PST` sits in
      `ABANDONED_STATUSES`, which is the sync's group and is named for fetching, so
      a card asking `isAbandoned` in order to decide what to draw would borrow a
      name that lies about why the badge is there — the mistake `foundations.md`
      already refuses to make with `--live` and `--flop`. The read side therefore
      got `CALLED_OFF_STATUSES`, a documented subset with a word per status, and
      `match-status.test.ts` asserts it stays inside the sync's group so that a
      status added for rendering can never enter a hydration queue.

      The badge itself cost no token: it is foundations' resting chip, on the
      argument that a called-off match is an absence and grey is what absence looks
      like here. And the match page's `sr-only` heading took the word too, or it
      would have announced a kick-off while the screen said the match was off.

      No schema change, no sync change, no request cost — `isDue` wants
      `isFinished` and `isLineupDue` wants `isPending`, so a called-off fixture
      sits in neither queue while it waits and rejoins the lineup queue by itself
      at its new kickoff.

      Deliberately not done: anything to what `--due` prints, so a postponement
      still passes through a run silently; and the matchday pager's date range,
      which this found and which became an open decision. **20 settled that one
      by deleting the pager** — a rescheduled fixture now moves to the day it is
      played on, which is the answer the question was looking for.

- [x] **18 — A fourth league, Serie A.** Done. `LEAGUES=39,94,140,135`, a probe,
      a sync run, and no product code — the read sides discover leagues from the
      `League` table, so no page and no Vercel environment was told, and there
      was no migration. What it cost beyond the variable is the part worth
      recording, because step 13 said the third league cost the variable alone
      and that stops being the whole story here: the variable has two homes and
      both had to move, the Italian flag is a file, a CSS rule and a map entry,
      and twenty clubs needed a code and a colour that API-Football does not
      publish. None of that is the league. All of it is decoration on a league,
      and it is separable — the pill draws correctly with no flag and grey chips,
      which is exactly what `foundations.md`'s third flag clause exists to
      guarantee.

      The probe settled four things before a file was touched: 135 is entitled on
      Pro for 2026 as every other league is, its coverage flags are false for
      2026 and it fetches anyway, its rounds are labelled `Regular Season - N` so
      `rounds.ts` parses them unchanged, and the provider calls it "Serie A" in a
      country it calls "Italy".

      **The name is the find.** `leagues.test.ts` had been using `'serie-a'` as
      its "a league we do not hold" fixture in four places, which this made false;
      they now name the Bundesliga. Underneath that is a real one: the provider's
      league 71 is Brazil's "Serie A", and the URL slug is derived from the name
      alone, so configuring both would make `serie-a` open the wrong competition
      silently. Asking `/leagues` for the whole catalogue put a number on it —
      1,239 competitions, 1,002 distinct names, 53 names shared by more than one
      country, and "Premier League" belongs to 35 of them.

      Serie A landed with its calendar and nothing hydrated, as La Liga did: its
      first round is played over 22–24 August, and the schedule will fill it with
      no commit.

- [x] **19 — The suggestion box.** Done. A labelled "Suggest a feature" button on
      the left of the top bar opens a dialog with one message field; the message
      is stored against the sender's account and read back by
      `npm run suggestions`. The app has users now, and no way for any of them to
      say what they want built was the gap this closes.

      **How loud the button is was the design decision, and it was taken twice.**
      Every other control in that bar is a bare glyph; this one is labelled and
      bordered, because it is the only one whose job is to be found by somebody
      who was not looking for it. It shipped as a label that dropped below `md`
      and an unbordered glyph, and the author asked for both to go further: the
      label at every width including the phone, and `inbox` in place of
      `lightbulb`, so the control reads as a suggestion box rather than as a
      hint. The narrow case was then measured rather than argued — 291px of the
      320px worst case, so it fits. An outline was tried in the same pass and
      taken back out: nothing else in that bar has one, and a bordered control
      inside a bordered strip reads as a box inside a box. It also spends the bar's left-hand space,
      which had been the standing candidate for the wordmark below `md` — see the
      open decision, now amended rather than closed.

      **Where a suggestion goes was the other decision**, and it went to our own
      Postgres rather than to an email or a GitHub issue. No new dependency, no
      new secret, and nothing that can be lost in transit; a notification can be
      layered on the same table later if the volume ever asks for one. A GitHub
      issue was rejected outright: the repository is public, and a user's words
      would become public writing they never agreed to publish.

      Deliberately not built: any screen that reads suggestions, any reply path,
      any category field, and any capture of which page the reader was on — the
      last because a path like `/matches/123` quietly records what somebody was
      looking at, in an app whose whole promise is that nobody sees your diary.

      What it cost beyond the feature is worth recording: one hand-added CHECK,
      one new glyph and no exception to anything (`inbox` is an ordinary Material
      Symbol), and a rate limit — the first write in the app to need one, because
      it is the first insert with no unique constraint behind a control anyone
      signed in is invited to press.

- [x] **20 — Fixtures by day.** Done. `/fixtures` shows one calendar day at a
      time across every competition, grouped into a section per league, with a
      pager stepping to the previous and next day that have fixtures. The league
      pill row and the matchday pager are gone, and the URL carries `?date=`.

      **Three reasons, in increasing order of what they cost to ignore.** A
      rescheduled fixture was unfindable: the provider keeps the round label and
      moves only the date, so SC Braga vs Gil Vicente sat under Matchday 1 for
      five weeks after it was played. A diary is indexed by the day you lived
      rather than by the competition's bookkeeping, so "today" is the entry point
      and a matchday never was. And **a round-based pager cannot represent a cup
      at all** — rounds there are two-legged and played across weeks — which is
      what would have forced this eventually regardless.

      **No schema change and no migration.** `Match.kickoff` was already indexed,
      which is the whole reason this was a query and rendering change.

      **The day boundary was the only hard part.** `dayRange` in `dates.ts` turns
      a date into the half-open span of UTC instants making up that London day,
      reading the offset twice because on a transition day the reading at UTC
      midnight and the reading at the answer disagree. Nothing adds 24 hours to
      anything: two days a year are 23 and 25 hours long, and `hydration.ts`'
      `DAY_MS` is correct for its rolling fortnight and wrong for this. It is the
      first `gte`/`lt` range in the app — a closed one would put midnight in two
      days at once — and `isDayKey` validates by round trip rather than by
      regexp, since any regexp loose enough to accept a real date accepts
      `2026-13-45` too.

      **The section order is a written-down list, and that was the decision.**
      Every derivable order is wrong: alphabetical opens on La Liga forever, and
      ordering by kickoff or fixture count promotes whichever league plays at
      lunchtime and reshuffles the page daily. Which competitions people follow
      is a fact about people and no column holds it. `LEAGUE_ORDER` is therefore
      a hand-written map beside `FLAGS`, legal on the same terms — an unranked
      league renders identically and sorts last, so a fifth costs no edit. A
      `League.rank` column was the alternative and was rejected for its
      migration, its seed script and the risk of the league upsert overwriting
      it; the fallback is already what an unset column would need, so promoting
      it later is contained.

      **A bare `/fixtures` is today even when today is empty**, chosen over
      falling forward or back: a page that silently showed a different day than
      the one asked for would be lying about what it is showing, and the arrows
      put the nearest real day one click away. They skip empty days rather than
      stepping one date at a time, or an international break would be eight
      clicks wide.

      It made the page faster as a side effect rather than as a goal. The chain
      of six sequential Neon round trips is two steps now — a date needs no
      lookup to resolve, so nothing has to be answered before the queries can be
      written.

      Deliberately not built: the league filter, which is the obvious next thing
      and is what will make the page survive fifteen competitions; any way to see
      a whole matchday, which nothing has asked for since the card started naming
      one; and any annotation of the design screenshots, which still draw the
      league row.

- [x] **21 — The diary by match.** Done. `/diary` has three tabs where it had
      five: **All**, **Matches** and **With notes**. The new one lists a row per
      match the reader recorded anything in, ordered by kickoff, naming the MVP
      and tallying the standouts, flops and notes.

      **It came from a user, and the complaint was "I cannot find things".** The
      diagnosis was structural rather than cosmetic: the diary lists judgements,
      so judging eight players in one match produces eight rows that all name the
      same fixture, and scanning it means reading past repetition. The list of
      matches was also the one list the app counted but never showed — the
      *Watched* tile on `/fixtures` has always counted exactly this set, and the
      new tab runs the same predicate so the number and the list cannot disagree.

      **Three tabs went, and only one of them was a loss.** Standouts and Flops
      each held a large fraction of a diary, so filtering to one returned a list
      the same size and shape as the one the reader was already failing to read —
      a filter that narrows nothing cannot help anyone find anything. MVPs was
      genuinely selective, and it is on the match row instead: a match has at most
      one MVP across both squads, so an MVP is a fact about a match rather than a
      slice of the diary. The stat tiles were never navigation and are unchanged —
      `/fixtures` draws the same four with no tabs at all — so dropping tag tabs
      orphaned nothing.

      **`?filter=` became `?view=`**, which is what the player profile already
      called the same control and what `foundations.md` calls it. The word had
      stopped being true: Matches does not filter the entries, it replaces them.
      The table behind it is a discriminated union now, so handing the matches
      view to `diaryEntries` — which has no query for it — is a compile error
      rather than a diary returned unfiltered.

      **No schema change and no migration**, which is the whole reason this was a
      query and a component. `Judgement` carries no `matchId`, so the tallies come
      from one `Match` query whose nested squad rows are filtered to the reader's
      own judgements and folded in JavaScript, the same shape `/players` uses for
      the same reason.

      Deliberately not built: any change to the four stat tiles, which still count
      entries written rather than matches watched — that is a different screen's
      question; a `?from=` on the match link, so arriving at a match from the
      diary still offers "Back to fixtures", exactly as the entry rows have always
      done; a `(season, kickoff)` index, since the semi-join is selective and a
      speculative index is a migration with no measurement behind it; and any
      redrawing of the design screenshots, which still show five pill filters.

## Long-term remarks

Standing constraints that were agreed explicitly, cannot be read off the code,
and outlive any one slice. Each names what would resolve it. A high bar — an
empty list is the expected state.

- **The design covers desktop only, and every screen must be designed narrow
  without a reference.** The export from Claude Design carries no breakpoints and
  no mobile mockups; both reference screenshots are ~2060px captures. 6.1b agreed
  the frame's rules and wrote them into `foundations.md`'s `### Responsive`
  section, but that settles the frame alone. Every screen since has resolved its
  own narrow layout by judgement against those rules — 6.2 the fixture card, 6.3
  the squad panels, 6.4 the tag controls, 6.6 the stat tiles, 7.1 the diary
  entry, whose date moves above the badge below `md` because 85px of monospace
  beside a player and a fixture does not fit on a phone, 7.2 the profile header
  and the split bar's legend, and 6.3b the scoreline, which stacks below `md`
  because a 320px line leaves about 136px for two 24px club names. The diary, the
  profile and the match page each arrived with a desktop drawing, so only half of
  each had to be invented; 7.3's two drawings arrived with the slice itself and
  are desktop-only like the rest, so its filter row, its two-line list row and its
  card grid were all decided narrow without one. 7.4's drawing arrived with the
  slice and is desktop-only like the rest, so its squad row inherited the
  players index's narrow arrangement rather than being drawn one, as did 7.5's
  club row and card grid from the same pair of drawings. 8.4's two drawings are
  desktop-only again, so the landing page's stacking order, and its header
  wrapping to two lines rather than shrinking its buttons, were decided the same
  way.
  *Can be resolved when narrow-width reference designs exist for the app's
  screens.*

- **A `Match` can exist with no squad rows, and code must cope with that.**
  Anything that lets a user pick a match has to handle a match nobody can be
  judged in, rather than assuming a squad is there. *Cannot be resolved.*

  It used to name the backfill as its exit, and read as a development condition —
  rounds 1 to 5 of 2024 hydrated, the other 330 matches bare. Moving to the live
  season made it permanent: fixtures are published months before team news, so a
  season in progress always contains matches whose squads do not exist yet. It
  was briefly total, with all 380 of 2026-27 bare; the Primeira Liga's first
  matchday broke that, and the leagues have sat either side of the line ever
  since — La Liga crossed it on its own opening weekend, the Premier League has
  yet to. The current hydration state is readable from the database; what this
  entry is for is the reminder that the empty case never stops being real. A
  league mid-season is the proof rather than the exception: most of its fixtures
  are bare at any given moment, because a squad is written 45 minutes before
  kickoff and not before.

## Testing

**Vitest is set up**, running over the sync mapper against the real captured
payloads — never JSON invented for the test. The mechanics, and why `npm test`
must stay out of the Vercel build, are in
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md#the-mappers-tests-read-scratch-which-is-gitignored).

- Do not test Prisma, Next's rendering, or other third-party code.

## Open decisions

- **`use cache` is still untaken, and step 20 removed most of the reason to
  want it.** This used to say `/fixtures` asked Neon six times in a row because
  each answer decided the next question. Indexing by day deleted the chain rather
  than caching around it: a date resolves without a lookup, so the day's
  fixtures, its neighbouring days and the season tallies go out together and the
  page is two steps. What is left to cache is reader-independent work on the
  other screens. The cost is not the caching: it is that `cacheComponents` is a
  different rendering model, so every page loses `force-dynamic`, every uncached
  read needs a `<Suspense>` boundary placed by hand, and `unstable_instant`
  exists to check the placement because getting it wrong silently blocks
  navigation instead of erroring. That is a step of its own, not a tail on
  another one. *Resolved by doing it, or by deciding the app is fast enough
  without it.*

- **Neon's production branch may be scaling to zero, and nobody has looked.** A
  suspended branch waking cost 544–860ms in step 16's measurements, which would
  land on the first click after any quiet spell and swamp everything that step
  fixed. It is a console setting rather than code, and it interacts with the
  schedule: the sync runs every ten minutes, which may already be keeping the
  compute awake for most of the day. *Resolved by reading the branch's setting
  and timing a first click after an hour of silence.*

- **The league flag is on `/fixtures` only, and cannot be on the two indexes as
  they are built.** Each section heading carries one; `/players` and `/teams`
  scope their leagues with a `<select>`, and a native `<option>` holds text and
  no markup. No styling changes that — it is an HTML limit, not a design one. If
  those screens want the same distinction the answer is `foundations.md`'s own
  ("use a word"): `"England · Premier League"` in the option label. Deliberately
  not done, because it changes what a filter control says, and the two indexes
  are the screens where a league is a preference rather than a location.

- **The app now has two conventions for screen state, and the older one may be
  the wrong default. High priority — a refactor the author may want.** Every
  screen before 7.3 keeps its state in the URL: `/fixtures?date=2026-08-23`,
  `/diary?view=matches`, `/players/44?view=notes`. Both indexes keep their three
  controls in `localStorage` instead, on the argument that they are
  *preferences* — how the reader likes a list drawn — where the others are
  *locations*. That distinction is written up in
  [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#a-location-goes-in-the-url-a-preference-goes-in-localstorage)
  and it holds; what is open is whether the older screens are on the right side
  of it.

  The reason to look again: **nothing in the app is shareable.** Diaries are
  private, single-user, no public profiles — so the URL's main advantage buys
  nothing today, while its main cost is real, because a view in the URL is
  forgotten the moment the tab closes. A reader who opens the diary for the
  matches gets the list of judgements on every visit. Against moving them: the
  back button stops undoing a tab change, the pages stop being server
  components, and a future share feature would want them back in the URL.

  Deliberately not touched in 7.3, 7.5 or 21, all scoped to one screen — though
  7.5 choosing `localStorage` again makes the newer convention the app's default
  in practice rather than its exception. Whoever settles it should decide for the
  diary's view and the profile's view tab together, which step 21 made plainly
  one question rather than two by giving them the same parameter name.

  **A cookie is a third option neither of the two offers, and the app no longer
  has one to point at.** This used to argue that `madooo-league` might be the
  answer for all of them: the league stayed in the URL *and* the last one chosen
  was remembered, so the address bar still said what the page was while a bare
  visit landed where the reader left off. Step 20 removed that cookie, because
  the fixtures page stopped having a reader-specific default to remember — a bare
  address is today, which is a fact about the world.

  The shape of the answer survives the instance and is still worth having for the
  diary's view: a cookie read on the server fills the URL's silence without
  giving up the server render. What it would not settle is which store the
  *state* lives in, only what happens when the URL says nothing.

- **Search is in the browser's memory, and that stops being right somewhere past
  five leagues.** `/players` ships the season's whole roster — ~15 kB compressed
  for one league — so a keystroke never waits on the network.
  At a few thousand players it is still the better trade; well past that, the box
  should ask Postgres instead. The swap is self-contained: the search field
  changes where it gets its answers and nothing else moves. It costs a route
  handler, debouncing, a loading state and out-of-order response handling, and it
  makes search visibly laggy, which is why it has not been built.

  This entry used to say *"revisit when a third league is synced"*, and step 13
  synced one. It was looked at and deliberately left alone — and the trigger was
  the wrong shape, because at the moment a league is configured it adds
  **nothing** to the payload: the list is players with squad rows, and a league
  that has not kicked off has none. La Liga demonstrated both halves of that
  within a week, joining the payload on its opening weekend rather than when it
  was configured. A league count was never the thing that moves this number.
  *Revisit when `/players` ships more than a few thousand players — which is
  measurable from the page itself rather than from how many leagues are
  configured.*

- **The club colours are not uniformly sourced, and the Premier League's are the
  block with no authority behind them.** Settled in 6.2: codes and colours are
  columns on `Team`, seeded by `npm run db:seed-teams`. The codes are the
  league's own abbreviations, which is a defensible external standard. The
  colours are not. The Primeira Liga's, La Liga's and eighteen of Serie A's were
  checked by the author against the clubs themselves and are confirmed; the
  Premier League's are each club's commonly published primary, entered by hand
  and never checked against anything. That block is what is left of the original
  problem, it is meant to be edited on sight, and a wrong one is wrong quietly.

  **A club that plays in white is the case the check exists for.** Real Madrid
  and Valencia have no drawable shirt colour, so each holds what the club is
  identified by off it — Madrid's crest blue, Valencia's black. Both were wrong
  on published primaries before the author corrected them, as were Levante,
  Deportivo and Barcelona, which is five of twenty in a block that looked
  plausible throughout. Serie A repeated the rate almost exactly — thirteen of
  the eighteen checked colours moved off the drafted primary — and left the same
  residue: Juventus and Udinese play in black and white, both hold flat black,
  and no check can tell them apart, which is the one case in four leagues that
  has no answer rather than an unchecked one.
- **The demoted MVP's chip waits for the round trip.** Each squad row is its own
  client island holding its own optimistic state, so nothing tells one row that
  another has just taken the MVP: the player losing it keeps a filled star until
  `refresh()` lands, and for that moment two chips read as MVP. Making it instant
  means hoisting the optimistic state into a provider above the rows — which can
  still wrap server-rendered children, the way `AppFrame` wraps `<Sidebar />`.
  Two sizes were sketched: a narrow one holding only the current MVP, leaving the
  counts and the summary to settle on the refresh as everything does now; and a
  full one holding the whole verdict map, which makes the counts and the summary
  client components and gives the exclusivity rule a second implementation to
  keep in step with the server's. Raised and deliberately deferred in 6.4.
- **The sidebar's avatar contradicts the design.** The foot is Clerk's
  `<UserButton showName />`, chosen because its menu is the only way to sign
  out. Its avatar is the Google profile photo, or a coloured gradient when there
  is none, and `foundations.md` forbids both photography and gradients. The
  design draws a grey circle with the user's initials. Replacing it means either
  restyling Clerk's internals or rendering our own chip and finding somewhere
  else for sign-out. Not urgent, but it is a knowing breach rather than an
  oversight.
- **Nothing identifies the app below `md`, and the space it would have taken is
  now spent.** The "Madooo" wordmark lives at the head of the sidebar, so on a
  narrow screen it is inside the closed drawer and the top bar identifies
  nothing. Putting the wordmark in that bar was the obvious answer while the bar
  was a menu button on an otherwise empty rail; 19 has since put the suggestion
  box on the left, so below `md` the bar reads menu button, a bordered "Suggest
  a feature" button, and the two icons pinned right. A wordmark would now be a
  fifth thing rather than the only thing, and it is the one of the five that does
  nothing when pressed — and the bar already says the app's name in words, just
  not its own.

  So the question has changed rather than been answered. It is no longer "should
  the wordmark go there" but "does a narrow top bar need identifying at all, now
  that it is visibly full of this app's controls". *Resolved by deciding the bar
  is identification enough, or by finding the wordmark a place that is not the
  bar.*

- **A suggestion records who sent it, and the dialog does not say so.** 19 stores
  `Suggestion.userId` — which is what makes a reply possible, tells one
  enthusiast from ten users apart, and gives the rate limit something to count —
  and the dialog says only "Read by the person who builds this. There is no
  reply." It does not claim anonymity, and attributing a form submission from a
  signed-in account is what nearly every feedback box does. But it does not
  disclose it either, and the author asked for it that way explicitly, for now.

  The reason it is written down rather than settled: this is the app's one place
  where a user's words leave their own diary, and *whether they know their name
  is on them* is exactly the sort of thing that is cheap to decide now and
  awkward to change after a few hundred rows exist. Three ways out, all small:
  say so in the hint line; add a "send anonymously" box and make the column
  nullable; or drop the column. *Resolved by picking one.*
- **Clerk's `colorNeutral` and `colorShadow` are unbound.** Every other
  appearance variable is a `var(--…)` pointing at our tokens, but Clerk derives
  alpha shades from those two in JavaScript and cannot interpolate a `var()`.
  Its greys and shadows are therefore still Clerk's own in both themes. Whether
  that is visible enough to be worth solving is a thing to look at with the user
  menu open in dark.

- **Nothing keeps the scheduled sync alive through a quiet 60 days.** GitHub
  disables a scheduled workflow after 60 days without repository activity. It
  emails first and the re-enable is a button, so this is not a silent failure —
  but it is a failure whose trigger is the author *not* working, which is exactly
  when nobody is looking at the repository. During the build it cannot happen;
  after launch, a season runs from August to May and a two-month gap in commits
  is ordinary. The options are to accept it and answer the email, or to give the
  workflow something that counts as activity. Deliberately not built in 10.2,
  because a job whose purpose is to keep another job running is worth choosing on
  purpose rather than adding by reflex. *Resolved by deciding either way once the
  first quiet month has actually happened.*

The paid API tier and the Clerk production instance used to sit here. Neither was
a decision — nothing about them was unsettled but the date — so both moved into
step 12, and the API tier moved again into step 9, which has now landed. Both are
done. What the tier left behind is a smaller thing of the same kind, back in the
checklist: the subscription is monthly now, so it has a date that recurs.
