# Foundations

See `colour.png` and `type-and-space.png`.

## The idea
A Google Slides "Simple" theme applied to a football notebook.

Non-negotiables:
- The border is the primary separator. Shadow means "this floats" — dialogs and toasts only.
- No gradients, no photography, no illustration, no texture, no pattern, no frosted glass, no emoji.
- Never hard-code a hex in product code. Always a semantic token.

## Colour

### Neutral ramp (base tokens — never change across themes)
| Token | Hex |
| --- | --- |
| `--gray-0` | `#ffffff` |
| `--gray-1` | `#f8f8f8` |
| `--gray-2` | `#eeeeee` |
| `--gray-3` | `#dddddd` |
| `--gray-4` | `#cccccc` |
| `--gray-5` | `#b0b0b0` |
| `--gray-6` | `#999999` |
| `--gray-7` | `#595959` |
| `--gray-8` | `#333333` |
| `--gray-85` | `#2b2b2b` |
| `--gray-90` | `#212121` |
| `--gray-9` | `#000000` |

### Accents (the six Google Slides theme accents + hyperlink)
`--accent-blue #4285f4` · `--accent-red #db4437` · `--accent-yellow #f4b400` · `--accent-green #0f9d58` · `--accent-purple #ab47bc` · `--accent-cyan #00acc1` · `--link-blue #1155cc`

### Tinted pairs (fill + readable ink on white)
| Pair | Fill | Ink |
| --- | --- | --- |
| green (STANDOUT) | `--green-bg #e3f3ea` | `--green-ink #0b7d46` |
| red (FLOP) | `--red-bg #fbe6e4` | `--red-ink #c5372c` |
| yellow (MVP) | `--yellow-bg #fdf3d9` | `--yellow-ink #a17400` |
| blue (info) | `--blue-bg #e6effd` | `--blue-ink #1155cc` |

The inks are darkened versions of the raw accents so the label passes contrast on white. The raw accent (`--*-mark`) is used only for the icon glyph inside inverse surfaces (toast).

### Semantic tokens

| Semantic | Simple Light (default) | Simple Dark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--page` | `#f8f8f8` | `#212121` |
| `--surface` | `#ffffff` | `#212121` |
| `--surface-alt` | `#f8f8f8` | `#2b2b2b` |
| `--surface-sunken` | `#eeeeee` | `#191919` |
| `--surface-header` | `#eeeeee` | `#333333` |
| `--surface-inverse` | `#000000` | `#ffffff` |
| `--surface-inverse-hover` | `#333333` | `#eeeeee` |
| `--border` | `#dddddd` | `#3d3d3d` |
| `--border-strong` | `#b0b0b0` | `#5c5c5c` |
| `--border-focus` | `#000000` | `#ffffff` |
| `--text` | `#000000` | `#ffffff` |
| `--text-muted` | `#595959` | `#cccccc` |
| `--text-faint` | `#999999` | `#999999` |
| `--text-inverse` | `#ffffff` | `#212121` |
| `--link` | `#1155cc` | `#8ab4f8` |
| `--link-hover` | `#000000` | `#ffffff` |
| `--overlay` | `rgba(0,0,0,.45)` | `rgba(0,0,0,.7)` |
| `--standout` / `--standout-bg` | `#0b7d46` / `#e3f3ea` | `#4bcf8b` / `#12331f` |
| `--flop` / `--flop-bg` | `#c5372c` / `#fbe6e4` | `#f28b82` / `#3a1c19` |
| `--mvp` / `--mvp-bg` | `#a17400` / `#fdf3d9` | `#fdd663` / `#3a2f0d` |
| `--info` / `--info-bg` | `#1155cc` / `#e6effd` | `#8ab4f8` / `#16243d` |
| `--live` / `--live-bg` | `#c5372c` / `#fbe6e4` | `#f28b82` / `#3a1c19` |

`--standout-mark #0f9d58`, `--flop-mark #db4437`, `--mvp-mark #f4b400` are the same in both themes.

**`--live` resolves to the same values as `--flop` and is still its own token.** A
match being played is not a verdict, and a token named for one of the three
verdicts would be lying about why the colour is there — the next person to
retune FLOP's red would silently retune the live badge with it. Red for a match
in play is the broadcast convention rather than a borrowing from the verdict
vocabulary, and the two never appear side by side: verdict words live on player
rows, `LIVE` on a scoreline. This is the only pair in the table that duplicates
another's values, and the duplication is the point.

**A match that was called off takes no token at all.** POSTPONED and CANCELLED are
drawn as the resting chip — `--border` and `--text-muted` on `--surface`, the
treatment an unpressed verdict chip already has. The reasoning runs the opposite
way to `--live`'s: that fact earned a token of its own because it needed a colour,
and this one needs the absence of one. Grey is what absence looks like here, and
the word carries the weight. Not `--live`, which states the opposite fact, and not
`--info`, which this system has spent on a note. No glyph either — Material
Symbols has none for "did not happen", and the answer to a missing glyph is a
word, as it is for the unrated chip.

### Club colours are the one sanctioned exception to the no-hex rule

A club's colour is a fact about the club, not a decision about the interface, so no semantic token could ever express it — there is no "Chelsea blue" in this system and there must not be. Club colours therefore live in the database, on `Team.colour`, and reach the DOM through an inline `style` on **a club mark**: the crest chip, and a player's shirt tile. Product code still holds no hex.

A club mark's ink is picked by contrast against that colour and is `--gray-0` or `--gray-9` — **base tokens, not `--text-inverse`**. The mark sits on a fixed colour, so its ink must not move with the theme; the neutral ramp never changes across themes, which is exactly the guarantee this needs. Both go through one function, so neither the fallback for an unseeded club nor the contrast calculation exists twice.

Only a club mark may claim this exception, and a new one has to go through that same function to count as one.

**A crest mark's letters take their size from the box, at one size only.** The three letters are `--text-caps` at 20px and 40px — the only role that is bold, tracked *and* capitalised, which is what a club code on a saturated colour needs, and small enough at both that it reads as a label. At 64px they are `--text-title` instead: 11px of type in a 64px square reads as a smudge in the corner rather than as the identity of the screen it heads. Not a new role, and never a raw size — 24px is on the scale already.

### Theming
Light is the default and needs no attribute. Dark is `data-theme="dark"` on `<html>` (or any container — it re-points semantics on any subtree). Only semantics re-point; base tokens never change.

### Links
`a { color: var(--link); text-decoration: none }` · `a:hover { color: var(--link-hover); text-decoration: underline }`

Selection: `::selection` is `#dddddd` on `#000000` (light), `#333333` on `#ffffff` (dark).

---

## Type

Two families, loaded from Google Fonts:
- **Archivo** (400/500/600/700) — everything spoken. Fallback stack `"Archivo","Helvetica Neue",Arial,sans-serif`. It is the neutral grotesque stand-in for the theme's Arial, with better weights.
- **JetBrains Mono** (400/500/700) — everything **counted**: scores, tallies, shirt numbers, dates, minute marks. Fallback `"JetBrains Mono","Roboto Mono",monospace`.

The rule: **if it is a number you can add up, it is monospaced.**

### Scale
| Role | Weight / Size / Line-height / Family | Tracking | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--text-hero` | 700 · 48px · 1.1 · Archivo | `-0.02em` | The landing page's opening line, and nothing else |
| `--text-display` | 700 · 40px · 1.1 · Archivo | `-0.02em` | Reserved for large headers |
| `--text-title` | 700 · 24px · 1.25 · Archivo | `-0.02em` | Page titles ("Fixtures", player name) |
| `--text-heading` | 600 · 18px · 1.25 · Archivo | 0 | Dialog titles, team names on MatchCard |
| `--text-body-lg` | 400 · 16px · 1.65 · Archivo | 0 | A note where it stands alone as prose — the Diary |
| `--text-body` | 400 · 14px · 1.45 · Archivo | 0 | Default UI text |
| `--text-label` | 500 · 13px · 1.25 · Archivo | 0 | Buttons, tabs, fixture lines |
| `--text-caption` | 400 · 12px · 1.25 · Archivo | 0 | Sub-labels, meta |
| `--text-caps` | 700 · 11px · 1.25 · Archivo | `+0.08em`, uppercase | Micro-labels: COMPETITION, STARTING XI |
| `--text-stat` | 700 · 32px · 1.1 · JetBrains Mono | `-0.02em` | Stat tile numbers, the 64px shirt tile |
| `--text-score` | 700 · 40px · 1.1 · JetBrains Mono | `-0.02em` | The match page's scoreline |
| `--text-tally` | 700 · 20px · 1.1 · JetBrains Mono | `-0.02em` | The 40px shirt tile, in a list row |
| `--text-data` | 500 · 13px · 1.25 · JetBrains Mono | 0 | Shirt numbers, dates, counts |

Sizes available: 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56.

48 was added for `--text-hero`. 56 remains on the list and is used by nothing.
Line heights: tight 1.1, snug 1.25, normal 1.45, loose 1.65.

**Caps appear in exactly two places**: the three verdict words (STANDOUT / FLOP / MVP) and micro-labels. Everything else is sentence case.

**A note takes its size from where it is read, not from what it is.** On a dense list — a squad row — it is `--text-body` in `--text-muted`, indented under the name with a rule, so the row stays a row. `--text-body-lg` is for the screens where a note is the content rather than an annotation on it.

---

## Spacing & layout

4px base, fine-grained at the small end because rows are dense:

`--sp-1 2` · `--sp-2 4` · `--sp-3 6` · `--sp-4 8` · `--sp-5 12` · `--sp-6 16` · `--sp-7 20` · `--sp-8 24` · `--sp-9 32` · `--sp-10 40` · `--sp-11 48` · `--sp-12 64` (px)

### Frame
| Token | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `--sidebar-w` | 232px |
| `--rail-w` (top bar height) | 56px |
| `--container` | 1120px max content width |
| page padding | 24px (`--sp-8`) at `md` and up, 16px (`--sp-6`) below |

Sidebar and top bar are fixed; content scrolls. Below `md` the sidebar is a
drawer — see Responsive.

### Responsive

The rest of this document is viewport-independent; this section is not. It was
added after the fact, because the reference screens were drawn at desktop width
only and the frame above describes a single layout.

**Breakpoints are Tailwind's defaults, unchanged**: `sm 640` · `md 768` ·
`lg 1024` · `xl 1280`. No custom scale. Nothing in `globals.css` overrides them,
and a parallel set would give the project two vocabularies for one idea.

**The frame's fixed widths stay fixed.** `--sidebar-w` and `--rail-w` never scale
with the viewport. Chrome has an intrinsic size set by its contents — a fluid
sidebar is dead space on a wide screen and truncates its own labels on a narrow
one. Layout responds by **changing arrangement at a breakpoint**, not by scaling
chrome. The sidebar is 232px or it is a drawer; it is never 180px.

**`md` (768px) is the frame breakpoint.** At and above, the sidebar is a grid
column exactly as drawn. Below, it becomes an overlay drawer opened from a menu
button in the top bar — the one control that exists nowhere in the reference
images, because they have no narrow state to have put it in. At 768px the sidebar
plus padding still leaves ~490px of content; much below that it does not.

**Author mobile-first — a CSS convention, not a statement of priority.** Desktop
is the primary target and the desktop result is what the reference images show.
But Tailwind's responsive variants are *min-width only*: `md:` means "≥768px",
and there is no plain "below 768" variant. So an unprefixed utility necessarily
applies at every width and prefixed ones layer on as the screen widens — hence
`h-(--row-h-lg) md:h-(--row-h)`, "44px, and 36px from 768 up". Inverting it with
`max-md:` mixes max- and min-width rules over one property, which is where
cascade bugs come from.

**`--row-h-lg` applies below `md`.** See Control heights.

Content stays fluid up to `--container`.

### Control heights
| Token | Value | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--row-h` | 36px | Nav items, dense rows — at `md` and up |
| `--row-h-lg` | 44px | Touch rows: the same rows below `md` |
| `--control-h` | 32px | Default button, input, select, icon button |
| `--control-h-lg` | 40px | Large button, underline tab |
| — | 26px | Small button / small icon button |
| — | 28px | VerdictChip (md), pill tab |
| — | 24px | Tag |
| — | 64px | Crest mark, square — a club profile's header, beside the 64px shirt tile |
| — | 40px | Crest mark, square — the match page's scoreline |
| — | 20px | Badge, crest chip |
| — | 16×12px | League flag mark, beside the name it marks |
| — | 16px | Checkbox / radio box |
| — | 34×18px | Switch track (14px thumb, travels 16px) |

### Radius — near-square
| Token | Value | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--radius-sm` | 2px | Checkboxes, badges, crest chips, flag marks, tooltip |
| `--radius-md` | 4px | **Almost everything**: buttons, fields, cards, tiles, dialogs, toasts |
| `--radius-lg` | 8px | Rare |
| `--radius-pill` | 999px | **Only two things**: Tags and pill Tabs (plus radio and switch) |

A **Tag** is a 24px pill in `--text-caps` with an optional 14px glyph, outlined in `--border` on `--surface`. It labels the thing it sits above rather than doing anything, which is what separates it from a pill tab: nothing about a Tag is selected, and nothing happens when it is clicked. The landing page's "Free and open source" is the app's only one.

No 12px or 16px "friendly" radii.

### There are two kinds of tab, and they mean different things

The table above lists both, and this is the rule that decides between them.

An **underline tab** (40px, `--text-label`) changes the *view of the screen you are already on* — which of your entries the diary shows, whether a player's profile is reading his verdicts or his notes. The selected one carries a 2px underline in `--text` and nothing else; the rest are `--text-muted` going to `--text` on hover. **The underline is under the selected tab alone — no rule spans the strip**, which is what lets the strip wrap on a narrow screen without a selected tab on the first row being detached from a rule under the last.

A **pill tab** (28px, `--radius-pill`) chooses the *scope the screen is drawn for*. The selected one fills with `--surface-inverse`; the rest are `--text-muted` on no fill, going to `--text` on `--surface-alt` on hover, which is the same muted-to-ink move the underline tab and the pager's arrows make.

**Nothing draws a pill tab today.** Its one instance was the league row on `/fixtures`, and that screen is now indexed by day rather than scoped to a competition — a day pager is its only scope control, and a league is a section heading under it. The specification stays because the distinction it draws is still the one to apply, and a filter over which competitions a reader follows is the obvious next thing to ask for it.

Both wrap rather than scrolling sideways, because a horizontal scroller hides its own overflow.

### A pill chooses a scope; a select narrows what is already on screen

The league used to be a pill row on `/fixtures` and is still a `<select>` on `/players`, and that was not two vocabularies for one idea.

A **pill** names the scope the server drew the page for. It is a fact about which page you are on, it shows every option at once, and there is nothing else beside it. A **select** sits in a **filter row** — a search box, one or two dropdowns, and any control that changes how the same list is drawn — and narrows what has already been fetched. Those controls have to read as one set, and a pill among them would claim a different rank than the things beside it.

The test is what the control changes, not what it names: a select never decides what the server queried, and a pill never appears in a filter row. A filter row is also the only place a select belongs — one on its own is a pill, or a tab.

### The filter row

A row of controls over a list, all at `--control-h` (`--control-h-lg` below `md`), wrapping rather than scrolling. The search field grows; the selects take a fixed width at `md` and up and share the remaining width below it.

Fields — text inputs and selects — take `--radius-md`, a `--border` outline on `--surface`, and **the field focus treatment rather than the ring**: see Interaction states. A select carries `expand_more` in `--text-muted`; a search field carries `search` in `--text-faint`, at the 18px size fields get. Both hide their platform appearance so the closed box matches the field beside it, and a select stays a **native** control underneath — the keyboard behaviour, the type-ahead and the phone's own wheel are not worth rebuilding.

A **segmented toggle** ends the row: two or three icon buttons, square at the control height, `--radius-md`. The selected one fills with `--surface-inverse`, as a selected pill does. Its glyph does **not** take `FILL 1` — the fill axis means "on" for the states listed under Iconography, and the inverse fill already says it here.

Borders: `--border-w 1px`, `--border-w-strong 2px`.

---

## Elevation
| Token | Value | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--shadow-0` | none | Cards, tiles — the default |
| `--shadow-1` | `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.12)` | Lifted row, switch thumb |
| `--shadow-2` | `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.14), 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.08)` | Raised card |
| `--shadow-3` | `0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,.18)` | Dialogs and toasts only |

Dark theme deepens all three: `.6` / `.7`+`.5` / `.8` alpha respectively.

`--focus-ring: 0 0 0 2px var(--surface), 0 0 0 4px var(--border-focus)` — a 2px black ring with a 2px surface-coloured gap; white in dark.

---

## Motion
| Token | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `--dur-1` | 80ms |
| `--dur-2` | 140ms |
| `--dur-3` | 220ms |
| `--dur-4` | 320ms |
| `--ease-standard` | `cubic-bezier(.2,0,0,1)` |
| `--ease-out` | `cubic-bezier(0,0,0,1)` |
| `--ease-in` | `cubic-bezier(.3,0,1,1)` |

Standard hover transition (`--t-hover`) is `background-color, border-color, color` at 140ms `--ease-standard`.

The complete motion inventory:
- Colour crossfade on hover — 140ms.
- Dialog and toast: fade + 8px rise — 220ms `--ease-out`. Scrim fades at 140ms.
- Switch thumb slide — 140ms.

Nothing else animates. No bounce, no spring, no scale-in, no page transitions, no skeleton choreography. **All durations collapse to 0 under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.**

---

## Interaction states

**Hover** — surfaces darken one step (`--surface` → `--surface-alt` → `--surface-sunken`); bordered controls darken their border to `--border-strong`; muted text goes to `--text`. Never opacity fades, never lightening on light backgrounds.

**"One step" means one step along the ramp, away from the page — not always downward in value.** The dark theme already reads that way: `--surface` `#212121` hovers to `--surface-alt` `#2b2b2b`, which is lighter. A **filled surface** inverts the direction for the same reason, so `--surface-inverse` hovers to `--surface-inverse-hover` — `#000000` → `#333333` in light. That is not the lightening the rule forbids: the clause is about a light *background*, and a filled button is a dark object sitting on one.

**A selected control is not a filled button.** A selected pill tab, a selected segmented button and a selected verdict chip all take no hover colour at all — clicking one again is a no-op, and press plus focus is affordance enough.

**Press** — one step darker again, plus `translateY(1px)`. No scale. A filled surface takes the transform alone: the step below `--surface-inverse-hover` would land on `#595959`, close enough to `--text-muted` to read as disabled. Same for a tint, which has no step below it either.

**Focus** — `--focus-ring` on `:focus-visible`. Fields instead take `border-color: var(--border-focus)` plus `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px var(--border-focus)`. Focus is never removed.

**Disabled** — `opacity: .4`, `cursor: not-allowed`, no other change.

**Error** — border goes `--flop`; the hint line is replaced by the error message in `--flop`.

**Verdict states** — resting is a plain outlined chip in muted grey; this matters, because most players stay unrated. Selected fills with the verdict tint, colours the border and label, and switches the Material Symbol to its filled axis. There is no third "neutral" state — unselected *is* average.

---

## Iconography
**Material Symbols Outlined**, variable font, weight 400, optical size 24, `FILL 0` by default.

**Filled (`FILL 1`) means "on"** — an applied verdict, the active nav item, a favourited player. Nothing else fills.

Sizes: 14 in badges and micro-labels, 16 in chips, 18 in buttons and fields, 20 default, 22 for large icon buttons. Icons inherit `currentColor` and are never given their own colour except through the element holding them.

Working vocabulary: `trending_up` (STANDOUT), `trending_down` (FLOP), `star` (MVP), `sports_soccer`, `edit_note`, `add_comment`, `visibility`, `how_to_reg`, `groups`, `view_agenda`, `view_list` and `grid_view` (the layout toggle), `menu` (the drawer), `lock_open` (the landing page's open-source tag), `stadium`, `two_pager`, `calendar_today`, `search`, `settings`, `notifications`, `check`, `close`, `expand_more`, `chevron_left`, `chevron_right`, `more_horiz`, `delete`, `share`, `arrow_forward`, `light_mode`, `dark_mode`, `trophy` (competition), `sports`
(the referee's whistle), `inbox` (the top bar's suggestion box).

The list that binds is `ICON_NAMES` in `src/components/icon-names.ts`, which is both the type `<Icon>` accepts and the subset request the font is fetched with. This paragraph is its prose companion and can fall behind it; the array cannot.

**No emoji, no unicode glyphs as icons, no hand-drawn SVG.** If a glyph does not exist in Material Symbols, use a word.

### A national flag is an identity mark, not an icon

The rule above forbids emoji and hand-drawn SVG because both are attempts to say something the Material Symbols vocabulary should be saying — a glyph competing for a slot in that list. A flag competes for no slot. It says *which* competition, the way a crest chip says which club, and Material Symbols has no flags and could not have them: there is no drawing of "England" a type designer adds to a set of interface glyphs. `trophy` still means competition and is unaffected. The ban on illustration at the top of this page is likewise about drawing, and a vendored flag is not a drawing.

So a flag answers to the club-mark rule rather than to this one, and takes the same kind of bar. A flag may be drawn where all four hold:

1. **It is data, not a decision.** It renders `League.country` as the sync stored it. Nothing at a call site chooses which flag appears.
2. **It goes through one function** — `flagClass` in [`src/lib/leagues.ts`](../../src/lib/leagues.ts) — so the fallback exists once, the way `crest` holds the club mark's.
3. **Its fallback is nothing at all.** A country the map does not know draws no mark and no gap, and the row is exactly what it was before flags existed. This is the clause that makes the map legal against `AGENTS.md`'s first non-negotiable: a fifth league still costs one environment variable, and its flag is an afterthought rather than part of the price.
4. **It sits beside the name it marks, never instead of it**, and is `aria-hidden`. The accessible name is the league's name, which is already there.

The files are four 4:3 SVGs in `public/flags/`, vendored from flag-icons under MIT, drawn as a `background-image` at 16×12 with a 1px inset ring in `--border`. The ring is not decoration: England is a white field, so it has no edge on `--surface`, and none on any pale fill. Italy needs the same along the top and bottom of its white centre band.

### GitHub's mark is a second identity mark, and the only one

The same reasoning, one step further. The octocat is not a hand-drawn SVG and competes for no slot in the vocabulary: it says *which* site the link goes to, exactly as a flag says which country. Material Symbols has no glyph for GitHub and could not have one.

It marks every link to the repository, and there are two: the top bar of the app shell, and the landing page's "View on GitHub" button. The button held `code` at first, on the reasoning that a Symbol is quieter beside five words of explanation. That was wrong about what the mark is for. `code` means *source* generically, so the button said "some code lives behind this" where the mark says which site you land on — and a visitor reads the destination off the octocat before reading the label. Two entrances to the same repository that looked nothing alike was the other half of it. `code` is no longer in the vocabulary; nothing else used it.

What forced the exception is that "use a word" had already been tried and failed. The link first sat at the sidebar's foot as a labelled row, and borrowing `NavItem`'s row height, icon column and hover fill made it read as a fifth destination. The mark is what lets it be recognised without being read, which is what lets it stop being a row at all.

It takes a bar of its own:

1. **One mark, and only where the repository is linked.** The top bar of the app shell, and the landing page's button. What is fixed is the mark, not the count: a link to the repository takes the octocat, and a *second non-Symbol glyph* — some other brand, some other drawing — is a new decision, not a precedent this section already granted.
2. **It is inline SVG, not a file in `public/`** — the one way it differs from the flags, and not a preference. An `<img>` cannot inherit `currentColor`, and the mark has to take its colour from the control holding it — `--text-muted` going to `--text` on hover in the top bar, `--text-inverse` on the landing page's filled button — and invert with the theme.
3. **It is `aria-hidden`, and the anchor carries the name.** "Source on GitHub". The mark stands alone with no visible label, so the accessible name lives on the control, exactly as it does on the menu button and inside the theme toggle.
4. **It sits 2px under whatever Symbol it stands beside.** 20px in the top bar, where the toggle is 22px; 16px in the landing button, where a button Symbol is 18px. A solid silhouette at the same nominal size as a 2px outline puts far more ink on screen; matching the boxes rather than the weights made it the loudest thing in a bar meant to be quiet. The 2px is the rule, and the sizes above are what it currently comes to.

GitHub's brand guidelines permit the mark for linking to a repository, which is the whole of what it does here. **This is not the licence club crests have** — `Team.logo` and `League.logo` still render nowhere, and this section grants them nothing.

Emoji flags remain out, and doubly. The first list on this page bans emoji outright, and Windows ships no regional-indicator glyphs, so a large share of readers would get two letters in a box — with England worse still, since it needs a subdivision tag sequence and 🇬🇧 would be wrong.

**Only a competition's country may claim this.** A player's nationality is a new claim about a person rather than about a competition, and would have to be argued on its own rather than inherited from here.
